<p class="pc4 xlarge">CRADOCK NOWELL</p>

<p class="pc4">&mdash;&mdash;&#9670;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="p2">It was a Tuesday evening when Cradock Nowell
and Amy Rosedew signed and sealed, with the
moonʼs approval, their bond to one another. On
the following day, Dr. Hutton and wife were to
dine at Kettledrum Hall; and the distance being
considerable, and the roads so shockingly bad&mdash;“even
dangerous, I am told, to gentlemen who
have dined <i>with me</i>, sir,” said Kettledrum, in his
proudest manner&mdash;they had accepted his offer,
and that of Mrs. Kettledrum, which she herself
came over to make, that they should not think of
returning until after breakfast on Thursday. In
consequence of her husbandʼs hints, Rosa felt the
keenest interest in “that Mrs. Kettledrum. Leave
her to me, dear Rufus. You need not be afraid,
indeed. Trust me to get to the bottom of it.”
And so she exerted her probing skill upon her to
the uttermost, more even than ladies usually do,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
when they first meet one another. Of course,
there was no appearance of it, nothing so ill&ndash;bred
as that; it was all the sweetest refinement, and
the kindest neighbourly interest. They even became
affectionate in the course of half an hour,
and mutual confidence proved how strangely their
tastes were in unison. Nevertheless, each said
good&ndash;bye with a firm conviction that she had
outwitted the other. “Poor thing, she was so
stupid. What a bungler, to be sure! And to
think I could not see through her!”</p>

<p>But the return&ndash;match between these ladies, which
was to have come off at Kettledrum Hall&mdash;where,
by&ndash;the&ndash;by, there appeared a far greater performer
than either of them&mdash;this interesting display of
skill was deferred for the present; inasmuch as
Rosa was taken ill during the mysteries of her
toilet. It was nothing more serious, however, than
the “flying spasms,” as she always called them, to
which she had long been subject, and which (as
she often told her husband) induced her to marry
a doctor.</p>

<p>Rufus administered essence of peppermint, and
then a dose of magnesia; but he would not hear
of her coming with him, and he wanted to stop
at home with her, and see that she sat by the
fire. She in turn would have her way, and insisted
that Rue should go, “for he had made himself
such a very smart boy, that she was really
quite proud of him, and they would all be so disappointed,
and he was taller than Mr. Kettledrum,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
she felt quite sure he was.” The bearing of that
last argument I do not quite perceive, but dare not
say that she erred therein, and to Rue it was quite
conclusive. So Ralph Mohorn was sent for, the
pony&ndash;carriage countermanded, and Rufus set forth
upon Polly, whose oats were now restricted.</p>

<p>Kettledrum Hall stood forth on a rise, and made
the very most of itself. Expansive, and free, and
obtrusively honest, it seemed to strike itself on the
breast (as its master did) with both gables. A
parochial assessment committee, or a surveyor for
the property&ndash;tax, would have stuck on something
considerable, if they had only seen the outside of
it. Look at the balustrade that went (for it was
too heavy to run) all along the front of it, over the
basement windows. No stucco, either; but stone,
genuine stone, that bellied out like a row of Roman
amphoræ, or the calves of a first&ndash;rate footman.
After that, to see the portico, “decempedis metata,”
which “excipiebat Eurum”&mdash;not Arcton in this
climate. No wonder&mdash;although it was rotten inside,
and the whole of it mortgaged ten fathom
deep&mdash;that Bailey Kettledrum hit his breast, and
said, “Our little home, sir!”</p>

<p>“Your great home, you mean,” said Rufus;
“what a noble situation! You can see all over the
county.”</p>

<p>They had come to meet him down the hill, in
the kindest country fashion, Mr. and Mrs. Kettledrum,
like Jack and Jill going for water.</p>

<p>“Not quite that,” replied Kettledrum; “but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
we saw you with my binocular, between two and
three miles off, and became so anxious about Mrs.
Hutton, that I said to my wife, ‘Put your bonnet
on;’ and she only said, ‘Bailey, put your hat on;’
nothing more, sir, I assure you; nothing more, sir,
upon my honour.”</p>

<p>Rufus could not see exactly why there should
have been anything more, but he could not help
thanking them for their kindness, and saying to
himself, “What nice people! Quite an agricultural
life, I see, in spite of that grand mansion.”</p>

<p>“Now,” said Mr. Kettledrum, when Polly had
been committed to one of the stable&ndash;boys&mdash;but
Rufus still wanted to look at her, for he never
grew tired of admiring anything that belonged to
him, and he knew they wouldnʼt do her legs right&mdash;“now,
Dr. Hutton, you have come most kindly,
according to your promise, so as to give us an hour
or two to spare before the dinner&ndash;time. Shall we
take a turn with the guns? I can put my hand
on a covey; or shall we walk round the garden,
and have the benefit of your advice?”</p>

<p>Rufus looked in dismay at his “choice black
kerseymeres;” he had taken his “antigropelos” off,
and was proud to find not a flake on them. But
to think of going out shooting! He ought not to
have dressed before he left home, but he hated
many skinnings. And he could only guess the
distance from the lodge to this place. So he voted
very decidedly for a walk in the kitchen&ndash;garden.</p>

<p>Into this he was solemnly instituted, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
beauties all pointed out to him. What a scene of
weeds and rubbish! How different from Bull
Garnetʼs dainty and trim quarters, or from his own
new style of work at Geopharmacy Lodge!
Rotten beansticks crackling about, the scum of
last summerʼs cabbages, toad&ndash;stools cropping up
like warts or arums rubbed with caustic, a fine
smell of potato&ndash;disease, and a general sense of
mildew; the wall&ndash;trees curled and frizzled up with
aphis, coccus, and honeydew; and the standards
scraggy, and full of stubs, canker, and American
blight, sprawling, slouching, hump&ndash;backed, and
stag&ndash;headed, like the sick ward of a workhouse
fighting with tattered umbrellas.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said Rufus, at his wits’ end for anything
to praise, “what a perfect paradise&mdash;for the songsters
of the grove.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” replied Mr. Kettledrum, “you should
hear the Dook admire it. ‘Kettledrum, my boy,’
he said, when he dined with me last Friday, ‘there
is one thing I do envy you&mdash;no, sir, neither your
most lady&ndash;like wife, nor yet your clever children,
although I admit that neither of them can be paralleled
in England&mdash;but, Kettledrum, it is&mdash;forgive
me&mdash;it is your kitchen&ndash;garden.’ ‘My kitchen&ndash;garden,
your grace,’ I replied, for I hate to brag
of anything, ‘it is a poor thing, my lord Dook,
compared to your own at Lionshill.’ ‘May I
be d&mdash;d,’ his grace replied, for I never shall break
him of swearing, ‘if I ever saw anything like it,
dear Kettledrum, and so I told the Duchess.’ And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
after all, you know, Dr. Hutton, a man may think
too little of what it has pleased God to give him.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Rufus to himself, “Iʼm blessed if
<i>you</i> do. But I donʼt like you any the worse for a
bit of brag. I have met great brags in India,
and most of them honest fellows. But I must peg
him down a bit. I must, I fear; it is my duty as
an enlightened gardener.”</p>

<p>“But you see, now,” said Bailey Kettledrum,
smacking his lips, and gazing into profundity,
“you see, my dear sir, there is nothing ‘ab omni
parte beatum;’ perhaps you remember the passage
in the heroic epistles of&mdash;ah, Cicero it was, I believe,
who wrote all those epistles to somebody.”</p>

<p>“No doubt of it,” said Rufus Hutton, who
knew more of Hindustani than of Latin and
Greek combined; “and yet St. Paul wrote
some.”</p>

<p>“Not in Latin, my dear sir; all St. Paulʼs
were Greek. ‘Nihil est,’ I now remember, ‘ab
omni parte beatum.’ I donʼt know how it scans,
which I suppose it ought to do, but that isnʼt my
look&ndash;out. Perhaps, however, you can tell me?”</p>

<p>“Iʼm blowed if I can,” said Rufus Hutton, in
the honesty of his mind; “and I am not quite sure
that it has any right to scan.”</p>

<p>“Well, I canʼt say; but I <i>think</i> it ought,”&mdash;he
was in the mists of memory, where most of the
trees have sensitive roots, though the branches are
not distinguishable. “However, that canʼt matter
at all; I see you are a classical scholar. And,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Hutton, I like a classical scholar, because he can
understand me. But you see that these trees are
rather&mdash;ah, what is the expression for it&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“Cankered, and scabby, and scrubs.”</p>

<p>“That is to say&mdash;yes, I suppose, they would
crop the better, if that be possible, for a little root&ndash;pruning.”</p>

<p>“You have gathered the fruit for this year, I
presume?”</p>

<p>“Well, no, not quite that. The children have
had some, of course. But we are very particular
not to store too early.”</p>

<p>“I really donʼt think you need be.”</p>

<p>“Why, many people say, ‘let well alone;’ but
my gardener talks of making&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“A jolly good bonfire of them, if he knows anything
of his business. Then drain the ground,
trench, and plant new ones.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kettledrum looked quite thunderstruck;
he caught hold of a tree to help him, and a great
cake of rotten bark, bearded with moss, came away
like the mask of a mummer. It was slimy on the
under side, and two of his fingers went through it.</p>

<p>“Nice state of things,” said Rufus, laughing.
“I suppose the Dook likes lepers?”</p>

<p>“Why, my dear sir, you donʼt mean to say&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That I would leave only one of them, and I
would hang the head&ndash;gardener upon it.”</p>

<p>That worthy was just coming round the corner,
to obtain the applause of a gentleman well known
to the <i>Gardenerʼs Chronicle</i>; but now he turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
round abruptly, and scratched his head, and
thought of his family.</p>

<p>When Rufus came down and entered the drawing&ndash;room,
he was perfectly gorgeous; for although
he had been in full dress for the main, he knew
better than to ride with his Alumbaggah waistcoat
on. There was nothing in all the three presidencies
to come up to that waistcoat. It would
hold Dr. Hutton and Rosa too, for they had stood
back to back and tried it. And Rufus vainly
sighed for the day when his front should come out
and exhaust it. He stole it, they say, from a
petty rajah, who came to a great durbar with it,
worn like an Oxford hood. At any rate, there it
was, and the back of Cashmere stuff would fit
either baby or giant. But the front, the front&mdash;oh,
bangles and jiminy! it is miles beyond me to
describe it.</p>

<p>All simple writers, from Job and Hesiod downwards,
convey an impression of some grand marvel,
not by direct description of it, which would be
feeble and achromatic, but by the rebound, recoil,
and redouble, from the judgment of some eye&ndash;witness.
If that eye&ndash;witness be self&ndash;possessed,
wide&ndash;awake, experienced, and undemonstrative, the
effect upon the readerʼs mind is as of a shell which
has struck the granite, burst there, and scattered
back on him. So will I, mistrusting the value of
my own impressions, give a faint idea of Rufus his
waistcoat, by the dount of it on that assembly.</p>

<p>The host was away for the moment somewhere,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
perhaps blowing up the butler, for his wife was
telling her sister how nervous and even fidgety
her beloved Bailey was growing; but Mr. Corklemore
was there, and came forth to salute the great
Rufus, when his heavy eyes settled upon the waistcoat,
and all his emotions exploded in a “haw” of
incredulous wonder. Mrs. Kettledrum rose at the
same instant, and introduced her sister.</p>

<p>“My sister, Dr. Hutton, whom I have so earnestly
longed to make acquainted with dear Mrs.
Hutton, Mrs. Nowell Corklemore; Mr. Corklemore,
I know, has had the pleasure of meeting you.
Georgie, dear, you will like her so&mdash;oh, goodness
gracious me!”</p>

<p>“I donʼt wonder you are surprised at me, Anna,”
exclaimed Mrs. Corklemore, with wonderful presence
of mind. “How stupid I am, to be sure!
Oh, Nowell, why didnʼt you tell me? How shameful
of you! But you never look at me now, I
think.” And she swept from the room in the
cleverest manner, as if something wrong in her
own dress had caused her sisterʼs ejaculation.</p>

<p>“Excuse me one moment,” said Mrs. Kettledrum,
taking her cue very aptly; and she ran out,
as if to aid her sister, but in reality to laugh herself
into hysterics.</p>

<p>After all there was nothing absurd, <i>per se</i>, in
Rufus Huttonʼs waistcoat, only it is not the fashion,
just at present, to wear pictorial raiment; but the
worthy doctor could not perceive any reason why
it should not be. He was pleased with the prospect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of creating a genuine sensation, and possibly
leading the mode; and having lost all chance of
realizing these modest hopes at Nowelhurst, why,
he must content himself with a narrower stage for
his triumphs. He had smuggled it from home,
however, without his wifeʼs permission: he had
often threatened her with its appearance, but she
always thought he was joking. And truly it required
some strength of mind to present it to
modern society, although it was a work of considerable
art, and no little value.</p>

<p>The material of it was Indian silk of the very
richest quality. It had no buttons, but golden
eyelets and tags of golden cowries. The background
of the whole was yellow, the foreground
of a brilliant green, portraying the plants of the
jungle. On the left bosom leaped and roared an
enormous royal tiger, with two splendid jewels,
called “catʼs&ndash;eyes,” flashing, and a pearl for every
fang. Upon the right side a hulking elephant
was turning tail ignominiously; while two officers
in the howdah poked their guns at the eyes of the
tiger. The eyes of the officers in their terror had
turned to brilliant emeralds, and the blood of the
tramping elephant was represented by seed rubies.
The mahout was cutting away in the distance,
looking back with eyes of diamonds.</p>

<p>Beyond a doubt, it required uncommonly fine
breeding, especially in a lady, to meet that waistcoat
at a dinner&ndash;party, and be entirely unconscious
of it. And perhaps there are but few women in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
England who would not contrive to lead up to the
subject, quite accidentally, of course, before the
evening was over.</p>

<p>The ladies came back as grave as judges; and
somehow it was managed (as if by the merest
oversight) that Dr. Hutton should lead to dinner,
not the lady of the house, whom, of course, he
ought to have taken, but Mrs. Nowell Corklemore.
He felt, as he crossed the hall with her, that the
beauty of his waistcoat had raised some artistic
emotion in a bosom as beautiful as its own. Oh,
Rufus, think of Rosa!</p>

<p>Let none be alarmed at those ominous words.
The tale of Cradock Nowellʼs life shall be pure as
that life itself was. The historian may be rough,
and blunt, and sometimes too intense, in the opinion
of those who look at life from a different
point of view. But be that as it will, his other
defects (I trust and pray) will chiefly be deficiencies.
We will have no poetical seduction, no
fascinating adultery, condemned and yet reprieved
by the writer, and infectious from his sympathy.
Georgiana Corklemore was an uncommonly clever
woman, and was never known to go far enough to
involve her reputation. She loved her child, and
liked her husband, and had all the respect for herself
which may abide with vanity. Nevertheless
she flirted awfully, and all married women hated
her. “Bold thing,” they called her, “sly good&ndash;for&ndash;nothing;
and did you see how she ogled?
Well, if I only carried on so! Oh, if I were only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
her husband! But, poor man, he knows no better.
Such a poor dear stick, you know. Perhaps that
is what makes her do it. And nothing in her at
all, when you come to think of it. No taste, no
style, no elegance! When <i>will</i> she put her back
hair up? And her child fit to put into long&ndash;clothes!
Did you observe her odious way of
putting her lips up, as if to be kissed? My dear,
I donʼt know how <i>you</i> felt; but I could scarcely
stay in the room with her.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless the ladies did stay, and took good
care to watch her, and used to say to her afterwards,
“Oh, if I were only like you, dear! Then
I need not be afraid of you; but you are&mdash;now
donʼt tell stories&mdash;<i>so</i> clever, and <i>so</i> attractive. As
if you did not know it, dear! Well, you <i>are</i> so
simple&ndash;minded. I am always telling my Looey
and Maggie to take you for their model, dear!”</p>

<p>On the present occasion, “Georgie Corklemore,”
as she called herself, set about flirting with Rufus
Hutton, not from her usual love of power, nor
even for the sake of his waistcoat, but because she
had an especial purpose, and a very important
one. The Kettledrum&ndash;cum&ndash;Corklemore conspiracy
was this&mdash;to creep in once more at Nowelhurst
Hall through the interest of Dr. Hutton. They
all felt perfectly certain that Cradock Nowell had
murdered his brother, and that the crime had been
hushed up through the influence of the family.
They believed that the head of that family, in his
passionate sorrow and anger, might be brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
to their view of the subject, if he could only be
handled properly; and who could manage that
more adroitly than his first cousin once removed,
the beautiful Mrs. Corklemore? Only let her get
once invited, once inducted there, and the main difficulty
after that would be to apportion the prey
between them. They knew well enough that the
old entail expired with the present baronet; and
that he (before his marriage) held in fee pure and
simple all that noble property. His marriage&ndash;settlement,
and its effects, they could only inkle of;
but their heart was inditing of a good matter, and
Mr. Chope would soon pump Brockwood. Not
quite so fast, my Amphictyonics; a solicitor thirty
years admitted (though his original craft may not
be equal) is not to be sucked dry, on the surprise,
even by spongy young Chope. However, that was
a question for later consideration; and blood being
thicker than water, and cleaving more fast to the
ground, they felt that it would be a frightful injustice
if they were done out of the property.</p>

<p>Only two things need be added: one that Sir
Cradock had always disliked, and invited them but
for appearance’ sake; the other, that they fairly
believed in the righteousness of their cause, and
that Rufus Hutton could prove it for them, as the
principal witness tampered with.</p>

<p>Mrs. Corklemore was now, perhaps, twenty&ndash;five
years old, possibly turning thirty; for that lustrum
of a ladyʼs life is a hard one to beat the bounds of;
at any rate, she had never looked better than she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
did at the present moment. She was just at the
age to spread open, with the memory of shyness
upon them (like the dew when the sun is up), the
curving petals of beauty. Who understands the
magnetic current? Who can analyze ozone? Is
there one of us able to formularize the polarity of
light? Will there ever be an age when chemists
metaphysical will weigh&mdash;no more by troy
weight, and carat, as now the mode is, but by
subtle heart&ndash;gas&mdash;our liking for a woman? Let us
hope there never will be.</p>

<p>That soft Georgiana Corklemore, so lively, lovely,
and gushing, focussed all her fascinations upon
Rufus Hutton. She knew that she had to deal
with a man of much inborn acuteness, and who
must have seen a hundred ladies quite as fair as
Georgie. But had he seen one with her&mdash;well,
she knew not what to call it, though she thoroughly
knew how to use it? So she magnetized him with
all her skill; and Rufus, shrewdly suspecting her
object, and confiding in a certain triarian charge, a
certain thrust Jarnacian, which he would deliver
at the proper moment, allowed her to smile, and to
show her white teeth and dimples of volatile velvet
(so natural, so inevitable, at his playful, delightful
humour), and to loose whole quiverfuls of light
shafts from the arch flash under her eyelids. What
sweet simplicity she was, what innocent desire to
learn, what universal charity. “How dreadful, Dr.
Hutton! Oh, please not to tell me of it! How
could any ladies do it? I should have fainted at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
once, and died half an hour afterwards.” She
turned up her large mild eyes, deeply beaming with
centralized light, in a way that said, “If I died, is
there any one who would think it a very, very
great pity?”</p>

<p>Rufus had been describing historically, not dramatically,
the trials of the ladies, when following
their regiment during a sudden movement in the
perils of the mutiny. With a manʼs far stiffer
identity, he did not expect or even imagine that
his delicate listener would be there, and go
through every hour of it. But so it was, and without
any sham; although she was misusing her
strange sympathetic power. Mrs. Nowell Corklemore
would have made a very great actress; she
had so much self&ndash;abandonment, such warm introjection,
and hot indignant sympathy; and yet
enough of self&ndash;reservation to hoop them all in with
judgment. Meanwhile Mrs. Kettledrum, a lady of
ordinary sharpness, like a good pudding&ndash;apple&mdash;Georgie
being a peach of the very finest quality&mdash;she,
I say, at the top of the table was watching
them very intently&mdash;delighted, amused, indignant;
glad that none of her children were there to store
up Auntieʼs doings. As for Mr. Corklemore, he
was quite accustomed to it; and looking down
complacently upon the little doctor, thought to
himself, “How beautifully my Georgie will cold&ndash;shoulder
him, when we have got all we want out
of the conceited chattering jackanapes.”</p>

<p>When the ladies were gone, Mr. Bailey Kettledrum,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
who had no idea of playing dummy even to
Mrs. Corklemore, made a trick or two from his own
hand.</p>

<p>“Corklemore, my dear fellow, you think we are
all tee&ndash;totallers. On with the port, if you please,
‘cessantem Bibuli Consulis amphoram,’ never shall
forget that line. The bibulous consul, eh! Capital
idea. Corklemore, you can construe that?”</p>

<p>“Haw! Perhaps I canʼt. Really donʼt know;
they beat a heap of stuff into me when I was a
very small boy; and it was like whipping&mdash;ha,
haw, something like whipping&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Eggs,” said Rufus Hutton, “all came to
bubbles, eh?”</p>

<p>“Not at all, sir, not at all; you entirely misunderstand
me. I mean that it was similar to&mdash;to
the result produced by the whipping of a top.”</p>

<p>“Only made your head go round,” said Mr.
Kettledrum, winking at Rufus; and thenceforth
had established a community of interest in the
baiting of “long Corklemore.” “Well, at any
rate,” he continued, “Hutton is a scholar&mdash;excuse
my freedom, my dear sir; we are such rustics
here, that I seldom come across a man who appreciates
my quotations. You are a great acquisition,
sir, the very greatest, to this neighbourhood. How
can we have let you remain so long without unearthing
you?”</p>

<p>“Because,” said Rufus to himself, “you did not
happen to want me; when are you going to offer
to introduce me to ‘the Dook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>?’”</p>

<p>“And now, gentlemen,” continued Mr. Kettledrum,
rising, swelling his chest out, and thumping
it athletically, “it is possible that I may be wrong;
I have never been deaf to conviction; but if I am
wrong, gentlemen, the fault is in yourselves. Mark
me now, I am ready, such is the force of truth, I
am ready here at my own board (humble as it is)
once for all to admit that the fault is in yourselves.
But the utterance I swell with, the great thought
that is within me, is strife&mdash;no, I beg your pardon&mdash;is&mdash;is&mdash;rife
and strongly inditing of a certain
lady, who is an honour to her sex. I rise to the
occasion, friends; I say an honour to her sex, and
a blessing to the other one. Gentlemen, no peroration
of mine is equal in any way to the greatness
of the occasion; could I say, with Cicero, ‘Veni,
vidi, vici,’ where would be my self&ndash;approval? I
mean&mdash;you understand me. It is the privilege of
a man in this blessed country, the first gem of the
ocean&mdash;no, I donʼt mean that; it applies, I believe,
to Scotland, and the immortal Burns&mdash;but this, sir,
I will say, and challenge contradiction, a Briton,
sir, a Briton, never, never, never will be free! And
now, sir, in conclusion, is there one of you, let me
ask, who will not charge his eyes, gentlemen, and
let his glass run over&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Haw,” cried Mr. Corklemore, “charge his
glass, come, Kettledrum, and let his eyes run over&mdash;haw&mdash;I
think that is the way we read it, Dr.
Hutton.”</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, I sit down; finding it impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
to obtain an adequate bearing, I close my poor
attempt at cleansing my bosom of the perilous
stuff, sir&mdash;you know the rest&mdash;the health of Mrs.
Hutton, that most remarkable children&mdash;excuse
me, most remarkable woman, whose children, I am
quite convinced, will be an honour to their age and
sex. Port of ‘51, gentlemen; a finer vintage
than ‘47.”</p>

<p>He had told them that it was ‘34, but both knew
better; and now “in vino veritas.”</p>

<p>At last Mr. Bailey Kettledrum had hit the weak
point of Rufus, and, what was more, he perceived
it. Himself you might butter and soap for a
month, and he would take it at all its value; but
magnify his Rosa, exalt the name of his Rosa, and
you had him at discretion.</p>

<p>“Remarkable, sir,” he inquired, with a twinkle
of fruity port stealing out from his keen little eyes,
“you really do injustice; so many ladies are remarkable&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Haw, well, I never heard&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Confound you, Corklemore,” said Kettledrum
to him aside, “can you never hold your tongue?
Sir,”&mdash;to Rufus&mdash;“I beg your pardon, if I said
‘remarkable;’ I meant to say, sir, ‘<i>most</i> remarkable!’
The most remarkable lady”&mdash;this to Corklemore,
in confidence&mdash;“I have ever been privileged
to meet. ‘What children,’ I said to my wife,
but yesterday, ‘what children they will be blest
with!’ Oh, heʼs a lucky dog. The luckiest dog
in the world, my boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>However, they were not so very far from the
sloping shores of sobriety when they rejoined the
ladies, and made much of the small Misses Kettledrum,
tidy children, rather pretty, and all of the
pink ribbon pattern. After some melting melodies
from soft Georgieʼs lips and fingers, Mrs. Kettledrum
said,</p>

<p>“Oh, Dr. Hutton, do you ever play chess? We
are such players here; all except my poor self; I
am a great deal too stupid.”</p>

<p>“I used to play a little when I was in India.
We are obliged to play all sorts of games in India.”
Dr. Hutton piqued himself not a little on his skill
in the one true game. At a sign from their mother,
the small Kettledrums rushed for the board most
zealously, and knocked their soft heads together.
Mrs. Corklemore was declared by all to be the only
antagonist worthy of an Indian player, and she sat
down most gracefully, protesting against her presumption.
“Just to take a lesson, you know; only
to take a lesson, dear. Oh, please, donʼt let any
one look at me.” Rufus, however, soon perceived
that he had found his match, if not his superior, in
the sweet impulsive artless creature, who threw
away the game so neatly when she was quite sure
of it.</p>

<p>“Oh, poor me! Now, I do declare&mdash;Isnʼt it
most heartbreaking? I am such a foolish thing.
Oh, can you be so cruel?”</p>

<p>Thrilling eyes of the richest grey trembled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
dewy radiance, as Rufus coolly marched off the
queen, and planted his knight instead of her.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Corklemore, can I relent? You are far
too good a player.” The loveliest eyes, the most
snowy surge, in the “mare magnum” of ladies,
would never have made that dry Rue Hutton, well
content with his Rosa, give away so much as the
right to capture a pawn in passing.</p>

<p>Now observe the contrariety, the want of pure
reason, the confusion of principle&mdash;I am sorry and
ashamed, but I canʼt express these things in English,
for the language is rich in emotion, but a
pauper in philosophy&mdash;the distress upon the
premises of the cleverest womanʼs mind. She had
purposely thrown her queen in his way; but she
never forgave him for taking it.</p>

<p>A glance shot from those soft bright eyes, when
Rufus could not see them, as if the gentle evening
star, Venus herself, all tremulous, rushed, like a
meteor, up the heavens, and came hissing down on
a poor manʼs head.</p>

<p>She took good care to win the next game, for
policy allowed it; and then, of course, it was too
late to try the decisive contest.</p>

<p>“Early hours. Liberty Hall, Liberty Hall at
Kettledrum! Gentlemen stay up, and smoke if
they like. But early hours, sir, for the ladies.
We value their complexions. They donʼt. That I
know. Do you now, my dearest? No, of course
you donʼt.” This was Mr. Kettledrum.</p>

<p>“Except for your sake, darling,” said Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Kettledrum, curtseying, for the children were all
gone to bed ever so long ago.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Georgie, coming forward, because
she knew her figure would look well with three
lamps upon it; such a figure of eight! “my
opinion is never worth having, I know, because I
feel so much; but I pronounce&mdash;&mdash;” here she stood
up like Portia, with a very low&ndash;necked dress on&mdash;“gentlemen,
and ladies, I pronounce that one is
quite as bad as the other.”</p>

<p>“Haw!” said Nowell Corklemore. And so
they went to bed. And Rufus Hutton wondered
whether they ever had family prayers.</p>

<p>When all the rest were at breakfast, in came
Mrs. Corklemore, looking as fresh as daybreak.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so ashamed of myself. What a
sluggard you will think me! What is it in the
divine song of that great divine, Dr. Watts?
Nowell, dear, you must not scold me. I cannot
bear being scolded, because I never have tit for tat.
Good morning, dearest Anna; how is your headache,
darling? Oh, Dr. Hutton, I forgot! No
wonder I overlooked you. I shall never think
much of you again, because I beat you at chess so.”</p>

<p>“Game and game,” said Rufus, solemnly, “and
I ought to have won that last one, Mrs. Corklemore;
you know I ought.”</p>

<p>“To be sure, to be sure. Oh, of course I do.
But&mdash;a little thing perwented him&mdash;his antagonist
was too good, sir. Ah, weʼll play the conqueror
some day; and then the tug of war comes. Oh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Anna, I am so conceited! To think of my beating
Dr. Hutton, the best player in all India.”</p>

<p>“Well, darling, we know all that. And we
must not blame you therefore for lying in bed till
ten oʼclock.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Rufus, with a groan, “do look at
ladies’ logic! Mrs. Corklemore gained one game
out of two&mdash;only because I was&mdash;ah&ndash;hem, I mean
by her very fine play&mdash;and now she claims absolute
victory; and Mrs. Kettledrum accepts it as a
premise for a negative conclusion, which has nothing
on earth to do with it.”</p>

<p>But Rufus got the worst of that protest. He
tilted too hard at the quintain. All came down
upon him at once, till he longed for a cigar. Then
Mrs. Corklemore sympathized with him, arose, their
breakfast being over, and made him a pretty curtsey.
She was very proud of her curtseys; she
contrived to show her figure so.</p>

<p>“Confound that woman,” thought Rufus, “I
can never tell when she is acting. I never met her
like in India. And thank God for that same.”</p>

<p>She saw that her most bewitching curtsey was
entirely thrown away upon him; for he was thinking
of his Rosa, and looking out for the good
mare, Polly.</p>

<p>“Dr. Hutton, I thank you for your condescension,
in giving me that lesson. You let me win that last
game out of pure good nature. I shall always
appreciate it. Meanwhile I shall say to every one&mdash;ʼOh,
do you know, Dr. Hutton and I play even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>?’
taking very good care meanwhile never to play
again with you. Shocking morality! Yes, very
shocking. But then I know no better, do I,
Nowell, dear?”</p>

<p>“Haw! Well, Georgie, I am not so sure of
that. My wife is absolute nature, sir, simple,
absolute&mdash;haw&mdash;unartificial nature. But unartificial
nature is, in my opinion&mdash;haw&mdash;yes, a very
wise nature, sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Haw!” said his wife, exactly like him, while
everybody laughed. Then she stood upon tiptoe to
kiss him, she was so unartificial, even before the
company. All the pretty airs and graces of a fair
Parisian, combined with all the domestic snugness
of an English wife! What a fine thing it is to
have a yoke&ndash;mate with a playful, charming
manner!</p>

<p>“Good&ndash;bye, Dr. Hutton. We are on the wing,
as you are. I fear you will never forgive me for
tarnishing your laurels so.”</p>

<p>Tarnishing laurels! What wonderful fellow so
ingeniously mixed metaphors?</p>

<p>“Now or never,” thought Rufus Hutton; “she
has beaten me at chess, she thinks. Now, Iʼll have
the change out of her. Only let her lead up to it.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Corklemore, we will fight it out, upon
some future occasion. I never played with a lady
so very hard to beat.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you mean at Nowelhurst. But we never
go there now. There is&mdash;I ought to say, very
likely, there are mistakes on both sides&mdash;still there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
seems to exist some <i>prejudice</i> against us.&mdash;Anna,
dear, you put a lump of sugar too much in my tea.
I am already too saccharine.”</p>

<p>“Well, dear, I put exactly what you always tell
me. And you sent your cup for more afterwards.”</p>

<p>“Matter of fact animal&mdash;how can she be my
sister?” Georgie only muttered this. Rufus
Hutton did not catch it. Mr. Garnet would have
done so.</p>

<p>“Now is the time,” thought Rufus again, as she
came up to shake hands with him, not a bit afraid
of the morning sun upon her smooth rich cheeks,
where the colour was not laid on in spots, but
seemed to breathe up from below, like a lamp
under water. Outside he saw pet Polly scraping
great holes in the gravel, and the groom throwing
all his weight on the curb to prevent her from
bolting homewards. “Hang it, she wonʼt stand
that,” he cried; “her mouth is like a sea&ndash;anemone.
Take her by the snaffle&ndash;rein. Canʼt you see, you
fool, that she hasnʼt seven coats to her mouth, like
you? Excuse my opening the window,” he apologized
to Mrs. Corklemore, “and excuse my speaking
harshly, for if I had not stopped him, he would
have thrown my horse down, and I value my
Polly enormously.”</p>

<p>“Especially after her behaviour the other night
in the forest. It is the same with all you gentlemen;
the worse you are treated, the more grateful
you are. Oh yes, we heard of it; but we
wonʼt tell Mrs. Hutton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, I hope you wonʼt. I should be
very sorry for her to get even a hint of it.”</p>

<p>“To be sure,” laughed Georgie, “to be sure
we will keep the secret, for ever so many reasons;
one of them being that Dr. Hutton would be
obliged to part with Miss Polly, if her mistress
knew of her conduct. But I must not be so
rude. I see you want to be off quite as much
as fair Polly does. Ah, what a thing it is to
have a happy home!”</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Corklemore sighed very deeply. If
a woman who always has her own way, and a
woman who is always scheming, can be happy,
she, Georgie, must be so; but she wanted to stir
compassion.</p>

<p>“Come,” she said, after turning away, for she
had such a jacket on&mdash;the most bewitching thing;
it was drawn in tight at her round little waist,
and seemed made like a horseʼs body&ndash;clothes, on
purpose for her to trot out in,&mdash;“come, Dr. Hutton,
say good&ndash;bye, and forgive me for beating
you.” Simple creature, of course she knew not
the “sacra fames” of chess&ndash;players.</p>

<p>“We must have our return&ndash;match. I wonʼt
say ‘good&ndash;bye’ until you have promised me that.
Shall it be at my house?”</p>

<p>“No. There is only one place in the world
where I would dare to attack you again, and
that is Nowelhurst Hall.”</p>

<p>“And why there, more than anywhere else?”</p>

<p>“Because there is a set of men there, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
which I can beat anybody. I believe I could
beat Morphy, with those men at Nowelhurst.
Ah! you think me, I see, grossly and stupidly
superstitious. Well, perhaps I am. I do sympathise
so with everything.”</p>

<p>“I hope we may meet at Nowelhurst,” replied
Rufus, preparing his blow of Jarnac, “when they
have recovered a little from their sad distress.”</p>

<p>“Ah, poor Sir Cradock!” exclaimed the lady,
with her expressive eyes tear&ndash;laden, “how I have
longed to comfort him! It does seem so hard
that he should renounce the sympathy of his relatives
at such a time as this. And all through
some little wretched dissensions in the days when
he misunderstood us! Of course we know that
you cannot do it; that you, a comparative stranger,
cannot have sufficient influence where the dearest
friends have failed. My husband, too, in his
honest pride, is very, very obstinate, and my sister
quite as bad. They fear, I suppose,&mdash;well, it
does seem ridiculous, but you know what vulgar
people say in a case of that sort&mdash;they actually
fear the imputation of being fortune&ndash;hunters!”
Georgie looked so arrogant in her stern consciousness
of right, that Rufus said, and for the
moment meant it, “How absurd, to be sure!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Georgie, confidentially, and in the
sweetest of all sweet voices, “between you and
me, Dr. Hutton, for I speak to you quite as to
an old friend of the family, whom you have
known so long”&mdash;(“Holloa,” thought Rufus, “in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the last breath I was a ‘comparative stranger!’”)&mdash;“I
think it below our dignity to care for such
an absurdity; and that now, as good Christians,
we are bound to sink all petty enmities, and
comfort the poor bereaved one. If you can contribute
in any way to this act of Christian charity,
may I rely upon your good word? But for the
world, donʼt tell my husband; he would be so
angry at the mere idea.”</p>

<p>“I will do my best, Mrs. Corklemore; you may
rely upon that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, thank you! I felt quite sure
that you had a generous heart. I should have
been so disappointed&mdash;perhaps, after all, we shall
play our next game of chess at Christmas with the
men I am so lucky with. And then, look to yourself,
Dr. Hutton.”</p>

<p>“I trust you will find a player there who can
give me a pawn and two moves. If you beat him,
you may boast indeed.”</p>

<p>“What player do you mean?” asked Georgie,
feeling rather less triumphant. “Any Indian
friend of yours?”</p>

<p>“Yes, one for whom I have the very greatest
regard. For whose sake, indeed, I first renewed
my acquaintance with Sir Cradock, because I bore
a message to him; for the Colonel is a bad correspondent.”</p>

<p>“The Colonel! I donʼt understand you.” As
she said these words, how those eyes of hers, those
expressive eyes, were changing! And her lovely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
jacket, so smart and well cut, began to “draw”
over the chest.</p>

<p>“Did you not know,” asked Rufus, watching her
in a way that made her hate him worse than when
he took her queen, “is it possible that you have
not heard, that Colonel Nowell, Clayton Nowell,
Sir Cradockʼs only brother, is coming home this
month, and brings his darling child with him?”
Now for your acting, Georgie; now for your self&ndash;command.
We shall admire, henceforth, or laugh
at you, according to your present conduct.</p>

<p>She was equal to the emergency. She commanded
her eyes, and her lips, and bosom, after
that one expansion, even her nerves, to the utmost
fibre&mdash;everything but her colour. The greatest
actor ever seen, when called on to act in real life,
can never command colour if the skin has proper
spiracles. The springs of our heart will come up
and go down, as God orders the human weather.
But she turned away, with that lily&ndash;whiteness, because
she knew she had it, and rushed up enthusiastically
to her sister at the end of the room.</p>

<p>“Dear Anna, darling Anna, oh, I am so delighted!
We have been so wretched about poor
Sir Cradock. And now his brother is coming to
mind him, with such delightful children! We
thought he was dead, oh, so many years! What a
gracious providence!”</p>

<p>“Haw!” said Nowell Corklemore.</p>

<p>“The devil!” said Bailey Kettledrum, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Rufus caught the re&ndash;echo, but hoped it might be a
mistake.</p>

<p>Then they all came forward, gushing, rushing,
rapturous to embrace him.</p>

<p>“Oh, Dr. Hutton, surely this is too good news
to be true!”</p>

<p>“I think not,” said Rufus Hutton, mystical and
projecting, “I really trust it is not. But I thought
you must have heard it, from your close affinity,
otherwise I should have told you the moment I
came in; but now I hope this new arrival will heal
over all&mdash;make good, I mean, all family misunderstandings.”</p>

<p>“Colonel Clayton Nowell,” said Mr. Nowell
Corklemore, conclusively, and with emphasis, “Colonel
Clayton Nowell was shot dead outside the
barracks at Mhow, on the 25th day of June, sir, in
the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred
and fifty&ndash;six. Correct me, sir, if I am wrong.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Rufus, “I venture to correct you
at once.”</p>

<p>“Shot, sir,” continued Corklemore, “as I am, I
may say&mdash;haw,&mdash;in a position to prove, by a man
called Abdoollah Manjee, believed to be a Mussulman.
Colonel Clayton Nowell, sir, commanding
officer in command of Her Majestyʼs Companyʼs
native regiment, N<sup>o</sup>· One hundred and sixty&ndash;three,
who was called,&mdash;excuse me, sir, designated, the
‘father of his regiment,’ because he had so many
illegitimate&mdash;haw, I beg your pardon, ladies&mdash;because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of his&mdash;ha, yes,&mdash;patriarchal manners, sir,
and kindly disposition,&mdash;he&mdash;haw, where was I?”</p>

<p>“I am sure I canʼt say,” said Rufus.</p>

<p>“No, sir, my memory is more tenacious than
that of any man I meet with. He, Colonel
Clayton Nowell, sir, upon that fatal morning, was
remonstrated with by the two&mdash;ah, yes, the two
executors of his will&mdash;upon his rashness in riding
forth to face those carnal, I mean to say, those incarnate
devils, sir. ‘Are you fools enough,’ he
replied, ‘to think that <i>my</i> fellows would hurt
<i>me</i>? Give me a riding&ndash;whip, and be ready with
plasters, for I shall thrash them before I let
them come back.’ Now isnʼt every word of that
true?”</p>

<p>“Yes, almost every word of it,” replied Rufus,
now growing excited.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, he took his favourite half&ndash;bred&mdash;for
he understood cross&ndash;breeding thoroughly&mdash;and he
rode out at the side&ndash;gate, where the heap of sand
was; ‘Coming back,’ he cried to the English
sentry, ‘coming back in half an hour, with all my
scamps along of me. Keep the coppers ready.’
And with that he spurred his brown and black
mare; and no man saw him alive thereafter, except
the fellows who shot him. Haw!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Rufus Hutton, “one man saw him
alive, after they shot him in the throat, and one
man saved his life; and he is the man before
you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“What you, Dr. Hutton! What you! Oh, how
grateful we ought to be to you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. Well, I donʼt quite see that,”
Rufus replied, most dryly. Then he corrected
himself: “You know I only did my duty.”</p>

<p>“And his son?” inquired Georgie, timidly, and
with sympathy, but the greatest presence of mind.
She had stood with her hands clasped, and every
emotion (except the impossible one of selfishness)
quivering on her sweet countenance; and now she
was so glad, oh, so glad, she could never tell you.
“His poor illegitimate son, Dr. Hutton? Will he
bring the poor child home with him? How glad
we shall be to receive him!”</p>

<p>“The child he brings with him is Eoa, dear
natural odd Eoa, his legitimate daughter.”</p>

<p>“Then you know her, Dr. Hutton; you could
depose to her identity?”</p>

<p>A very odd question; but some women have
almost the gift of prophecy.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! I should rather think so. I have
known her since she was ten years old.”</p>

<p>“And now they are coming home. How pleasant!
How sweet to receive them, as it were from
the dead! By the overland route, I suppose, and
with a lac of rupees?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the badgered Rufus, “you are wrong
in both conjectures. They come round the Cape,
by the clipper&ndash;ship <i>Aliwal</i>; and with very few
rupees. Colonel Nowell has always been extravagant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
a wonderfully fine&ndash;hearted man, but a hand
that could never hold anything&mdash;except, indeed, a
friendʼs.”</p>

<p>By the moisture in Rue Huttonʼs eyes, Georgie
saw that her interests would fare ill with him, if
brought into competition with those of Colonel
Nowell. Meanwhile Polly was raving wild, and it
took two grooms to hold her, and the white froth
dribbling down her curb was to Rufus Hutton as
the foam of the sea to a sailor. He did love a
tearing gallop, only not through the thick of the
forest.</p>

<p>“Good&ndash;bye, good&ndash;bye! I shall see you soon.
Thank you, I will take a cheroot. But I only
smoke my own. Good&ndash;bye! I am so much obliged
to you. You have been so very kind. Mrs.
Hutton will be miserable until you come over to
us. Good&ndash;bye; once more, good&ndash;bye!”</p>

<p>Rufus Hutton, you see, was a man of the world,
and could be false “on occasion.” John Rosedew
could never have made that speech on the back of
detected falsehood. Away went Polly, like a gale
of wind; and Rufus (who was no rogue by nature,
only by the force of circumstances, and then could
never keep to it), he going along twenty miles an
hour, set his teeth to the breeze, which came down
the funnel of his cigar as down a steamerʼs chimney,
stuck his calves well into Pollyʼs sides, and felt
himself a happy man, going at a rocketʼs speed, to
a home of happiness. All of us who have a home
(and unless we leave our heart there, whenever we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
go away, we have no home at all), all of us who
have a hole in this shifting sandy world&mdash;the sand
as of an hour&ndash;glass&mdash;but whence we have spun
such a rope as the devil can neither make nor
break&mdash;I mean to say, we, all who love, without
any hems, and haws, and rubbish, those who are
only our future tense (formed from the present by
adding “so”)&mdash;all of us who are lucky enough, I
believe we may say good enough, to want no temporal
augment from the prefix of society, only to
cling upon the tree to the second aorist of our
children, wherein the root of the man lurks, the
grand indefinite so anomalous; all these fellows,
if they can anyhow understand this sentence,
will be glad to hear that Rufus Hutton had a jolly
ride.</p>

<p>Rosa waited at the gate; why do his mareʼs
shoes linger? Rosa ran in, and ran out again, and
was sure that she heard something pelting down
the hill much too fast, for her sake! but who
could blame him when he knew he was coming
home at last? Then Rosa snapped poor Jonahʼs
head off, for being too thick to hear it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a mighty senate was held at Kettledrum
Hall, Mrs. Corklemore herself taking the
curule chair. After a glimpse of natural life, and
the love of man and woman, we want no love of
money; so we lift our laps (like the Roman
envoy) and shake out war with the whole of
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Fools who think that life needs gilding&mdash;life,
whose flowing blood contains every metal but
gold and silver&mdash;because they clog and poison it!
Blessed is he who earns his money, and spends it
all on a Saturday. He looks forward to it throughout
the week; and the beacon of life is hope, even
as God is its pole&ndash;star.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="p2">Mr. Garnetʼs house, well away to the west,
was embraced more closely and lovingly by the
gnarled arms of the Forest than the Hall, or even
the Rectory. Just in the scoop of a sunny valley,
high enough to despise the water, and low enough
to defy the wind, there was nothing to concern it
much, but the sighing of the branches. Over the
brown thatch hung two oak&ndash;trees, whispering
leaves of history, offering the acorn cup upon the
parlour hearth, chafing their rheumatic knuckles
against the stone of the chimneys, wondering
when the great storm should come that would give
them an inside view of it. For though the cottage
lay so snugly, scarcely lifting its thatched eyebrows
at the draught which stole up the valley,
nevertheless those guardian oaks had wrestled a
bout or two with the tempests. In the cyclone on
the morning of November 29th, 1836, and again
on the 7th of January, 1842, they had gripped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the ground, and set hard their knees, and groaned
at the thought of salt water. Since then the wind
had been less of a lunatic (although there had
been some ruffianly work in 1854), and they
hoped there was a good time coming, and so
spread their branches further and further, and
thought less of the price of timber. There was
only one wind that frightened them much, and
that was two points north of west, the very direction
whence, if they fell, crash they must come on
the cottage. For they stood above it, the root&ndash;head
some ten feet above the back&ndash;floor of the
basement, and the branches towering high enough
for a wood&ndash;pigeon not to be nervous there.</p>

<p>Now we only get heavy pressure of squalls from
the west&ndash;north&ndash;west after a thorough&ndash;going tempest
which has begun in the southward, and means to
box half the compass. So the two great oaks were
regarded by their brethren up the hill as jolly
fellows, happy dogs, born with a silver spoon in
their mouths, good for another thousand years,
although they might be five hundred old; unless,
indeed&mdash;and here all the trees shuddered&mdash;there
came such another hurricane as in 1703. But
which of us knows his own brotherʼs condition?
Those two oaks stood, and each knew it, upon a
steep bank, where no room was for casting out
stay&ndash;roots to east&ndash;south&ndash;east.</p>

<p>Bull Garnet hated those two trees, with terror
added to hatred. Even if they never crushed
him, which depended much on the weather, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
<i>would</i> come in at his bedroom window when the
moon was high. Wandering shapes of wavering
shadow, with the flickering light between them,
walking slowly as a ghost does, and then very
likely a rustle and tap, a shivering, a shuddering;
it made the ground&ndash;floor of his heart shake in the
nightmare hours.</p>

<p>Never before had he feared them so much, one
quarter so much, as this October; and, during the
full and the waning moon after Clayton Nowellʼs
death, he got very little sleep for them. By day
he worked harder than ever, did more than three
men ought to do, was everywhere on the estates,
but never swore at any one&mdash;though the men
scratched their ears for the want of it&mdash;laboured
hard, and early, and late, if so he might come home
at night (only not in the dark), come home at
night thoroughly weary. His energy was amazing.
No man anywhere felling wood&mdash;Mr. Garnetʼs
especial luxury&mdash;no man hedging and ditching, or
frithing, or stubbing up fern and brambles, but
had better look out what he had in his bag, or “the
governor would be there, and no mistake.” A workman
could scarcely stand and look round, and wonder
how his sick wife was, or why he had got to work
so hard, could scarcely slap himself on the breast,
or wet his hard hands for a better grip, but there
was Bull Garnet before him, with sad, fierce,
dogged eyes, worse than his strongest oaths had
been.</p>

<p>Everybody said it was (and everybody believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
it; for the gossip had spread from the household
in spite of the maidens’ fear of him) the cause of it
was, beyond all doubt, the illness of his daughter.
Pearl Garnet, that very eccentric girl, as Rufus
Hutton concluded, who had startled poor Polly so
dreadfully, was prostrate now with a nervous fever,
and would not see even the doctor. Our Amy, who
pleaded hard to see her, because she was sure she
could do her good, received a stern sharp negative,
and would have gone away offended, only she was
so sorry for her. Not that any fervid friendship,
such as young ladies exult in for almost a fortnight
incessant, not that any rapturous love exclusive of
all <i>man</i>kind had ever arisen between them, for they
had nothing whatever in common, save beauty and
tenacity, which girls do not love in each other:
only that she was always sorry for any one deep
in trouble. And believing that Pearl had loved
Clayton Nowell, and was grieving for him bitterly,
how could Amy help contrasting that misery with
her own happiness?</p>

<p>For Amy was nice and happy now, in spite of
Cradockʼs departure, and the trouble he had departed
in. He loved her almost half as much, she
believed, as she loved him; and was not that
enough for anybody? His troubles would flow by
in time; who on earth could doubt it, unless they
doubted God? He was gone to make his way in
the world, and her only fear was lest he should
make it too grand for Amy to share in. She liked
the school&ndash;children so, and the pony, and to run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
out now and then to the kitchen, and dip a bit of
crust in the dripping&ndash;pan; and she liked to fill her
dear fatherʼs pipe, and spread a thin handkerchief
over his head. Would all these pleasures be out
of her sphere, when Cradock came back, with all
London crowning him the greatest and best man
of the age? Innocent Amy, never fear. “Nemo,
nisi ob homicidium, repente fuit clarissimus.”</p>

<p>Mr. Garnet would have felled those oaks, in
spite of Sir Cradockʼs most positive orders, if there
had not been another who could not command, but
could plead for them. Every morning as the
steward came out, frowned and shook his fist at
them, the being whom he loved most on earth&mdash;far
beyond himself, his daughter, and the memory of
their mother, all multiplied into each other,&mdash;that
boy Bob came up to him, and said, “Father,
donʼt, <i>for my sake</i>.”</p>

<p>We have not heard much of Bob Garnet yet;
we have scarcely shaped him feebly; by no means
was he a negative character, yet described most
briefly by negatives. In every main point, except
two, he was his fatherʼs cardinal opposite. Those
two were generosity (which combines the love of
truth with a certain warmth of impulse) and persevering
energy. Even those two were displayed in
ways entirely different, but the staple was very
similar.</p>

<p>Bob Garnet was a naturalist. Gentle almost as
any girl, and more so than his sister, he took small
pleasure in the ways of men, intense delight in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
those of every other creature. Bob loved all things
God had made, even as fair Amy did. All his
day, and all his life, he would have spent, if he had
the chance, among the ferns and mosses, the desmidiæ
of the forest pools, the sun&ndash;dew and the
fungi, the buff&ndash;tips and red underwings, privet&ndash;hawks,
and emperors. He knew all the children
of the spring and handmaids of the summer, all of
autumnʼs laden train and the comforters of winter.
The happiest of mankind is he whose stores of
life are endless, whose pure delights can never cloy,
who sees and feels in every birth, in every growth
or motion, his own Almighty Father; and loving
Him is loved again, as a child who spreads his
arms out.</p>

<p>Mr. Garnetʼs affection for this boy surpassed the
love of women. He petted, and patted, and coaxed
him, and talked nonsense to him by the hour; he
was jealous even of Bobʼs attachment to his sister
Pearl; in short, all the energy of his goodness,
which, like the rest of his energies, transcended
the force of other menʼs, centred and spent itself
mainly there. But of late Bob had passed all
his time with his mother&mdash;I mean, of course,
with Nature; for his mother in the flesh was dead
many a year ago. He had now concluded, with
perfect contentment, that his education was
finished; and to have the run of the forest at
this unwonted season more than consoled him for
the disgrace of his recent expulsion from school.</p>

<p>Scarcely any one would believe that Bob Garnet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the best and gentlest boy that ever cried over Euripides&mdash;not
from the pathos of the poet certainly,
but from his own&mdash;Bob Garnet, who sang to
snails to come out, and they felt that he could not
beat them, should have been expelled disgracefully
from a private school, whose master must needs
expel his own guineas with every banished pupil.
However, so it was, and the crime was characteristic.
He <i>would</i> sit at night in the lime&ndash;trees.
Those lime&ndash;trees overhung the grey stone wall of
the playground near Southampton; and some
wanton boys had been caught up there, holding
amoibæans with little nursemaids and girls of all
work, come out to get lung&ndash;and&ndash;tongue food.
Thereupon a stern ukase was issued that the next
boy caught up there would be expelled without
trial, as the corrupter of that pure flock. The
other boys laughed, I am sorry to say, when “Bob,
the natural,” as they called him, meaning thereby
the naturalist, was the first to be discovered there,
crawling upon a branch as cleverly as a looper
caterpillar. Even then the capital sentence was
commuted that time, for every master knew, as well
as every boy, that Bob could never “say bo” to
anything of the feminine gender capable of articulating.
So Bob had to learn the fourth Georgic
by heart, and did most of it (with extreme enjoyment)
up in that very same tree. For he kept all
his caterpillars there, his beetle&ndash;traps, his moth&ndash;nets,
even some glorious pupæ, which were due at
the end of August; and he nursed a snug little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
fernery, and had sown some mistletoe seeds, and a
dozen other delicious things, and the lime&ndash;hawks
wanted to burrow soon; in a word, it was Bobʼs
hearth and heart&ndash;place, for no other boy could
scale it. But just when Bob had got to the beginning
of Aristæus, and the late bees were buzzing
around him, although the linden had berried,
an officious usher spied him out&mdash;a dirty little
fellow, known and despised by all the more respectable
<i>σιωπητέαι</i> of Southampton. With hottest
indignation, that mean low beggar cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>“Boy in the tree there! I see you! Your
name this moment, you rascal!”</p>

<p>“Garnet, sir, Bob Garnet. And if you please,
sir, I am not a rascal.”</p>

<p>“Come down, sir, this very instant; or else Iʼll
come up after you.”</p>

<p>“I donʼt think you can, sir,” replied Bob, looking
down complacently; for, as we shall see
by&ndash;and&ndash;by, he was no coward in an emergency.
“If you please, sir, no boy in the school can
climb this tree except me, sir, since Brown senior
left.”</p>

<p>“I can tell you one thing, Garnet: itʼs the last
time youʼll ever climb it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then I must collect my things; I am sorry
to keep you waiting, sir. But they are such beauties,
and I canʼt see well to pack them.”</p>

<p>Bob packed up his treasures deliberately in his
red pocket&ndash;handkerchief, and descended very cleverly,
holding it with his teeth. The next morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
he had to pack his box, and became in the school a
mere legend.</p>

<p>His father flew into a violent passion, not with
the son, but the schoolmaster: however, he was
so transported with joy at getting his own Bob
home again, that he soon forgave the cause of it.
So the boy got the run of the potato&ndash;fields, pollard&ndash;trees,
and rushy pools, and hunted and grubbed
and dabbled, and came home sometimes with three
handkerchiefs, not to mention his hat, full. One
lovely day this October, before the frost set in&mdash;a
frost of a length and severity most rare at that
time of year&mdash;Bob Garnet took his basket and
trowel, nets, lens, &amp;c., and set out for a sandy
patch, not far from the stream by the Rectory,
where in his July holidays he had found some
Gladiolus Illyricus, a bloom of which he had carried
home, and now he wanted some roots of it. He
could not think why his father left him so very
much to himself now, and had ceased from those
little caresses and fondlings, which used to make
Bob look quite ashamed sometimes in the presence
of strangers. He felt that his father loved him
quite as much as ever, and he had found those
strong eyes set upon him with an expression, as it
appeared to him, of sorrow and compassion. He
had a great mind to ask what the matter was; but
his love for his father was a strange feeling, mixed
with some dread and uncertainty. He would make
Pearl tell him all about it, that would be the best
way; for she as well had been carrying on very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
oddly of late. She sat in her own room all day
long, and would never come down to dinner, and
would never come out for a stroll with him, but
slipped out by herself sometimes in the evening;
that, at least, he was sure of. And to tell him indeed,
him going on now for seventeen years of age,
that he was too young to ask questions! He would
let her know, he was quite resolved, that because
she happened to be two years older&mdash;a pretty reason
that was for treating him like a baby! She who
didnʼt know a wire&ndash;worm from a ring&ndash;worm, nor
an elater from a tipula, and thought that the tippet&ndash;moth
was a moth that fed upon tippets! Recalling
fifty other instances of poor Pearlʼs deep ignorance,
Bob grew more and more indignant, as he thought
of the way she treated him. He would stand it no
longer. If she was in trouble, that was only the
greater reason&mdash;&mdash; Holloa!</p>

<p>Helter&ndash;skelter, off dashed Bob after a Queen of
Spain fritillary, the first he had ever seen on the
wing, and a grand prize for any collector, even of
ten times his standing. It was one of the second
brood, invited by the sun to sport awhile. And
rare sport it afforded Bob, who knew it at once
from the other fritillaries, for the shape of the
wings is quite different, and he had seen it in grand
collections. An active little chap it was, greatly
preferring life to death, and thoroughly aware that
man is the latterʼs chief agent. Once Bob made
quite sure of it, for it had settled on a blackberry&ndash;spray,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and smack the net came down upon it, but
a smack too hard, for the thorns came grinning out
at the bottom, and away went the butterfly laughing.
Bob made good the net in a moment with
some very fine pins that he carried, and off again
in still hotter pursuit, having kept his eyes on dear
Lathonia. But the prey was now grown wondrous
skeary since that narrow shave, and the huntsman
saw that his only chance was a clever swoop in mid
air. So he raised his net high, and zig&ndash;zagged
recklessly round the trees, through the bushes, up
the banks and down them. At last he got quite
close to her, but she flipped round a great beech&ndash;trunk;
Bob made a cast at hazard, and caught not
the Queen, but Amy.</p>

<p>Amy was not frightened much, neither was she
hurt, though her pretty round head came out
through the net&mdash;for she had taken her hat off&mdash;and
the ring lay upon her shoulders, which the
rich hair had shielded from bruises. She would
have been frightened terribly, only she knew what
was going on, and had stepped behind the tree to
avoid the appearance of interfering. For she did
not wish&mdash;she knew not why&mdash;but, by some instinct,
she did not wish to have much to do with
the Garnets. She regarded poor Bob as a schoolboy,
who was very fond of insects, and showed his
love by killing them.</p>

<p>But if Amy was not frightened much, Bob,
the captor, was. He dropped the handle of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
net, and fell back against the beech&ndash;tree. Then
Amy laughed, and took off the net, or the relics of
the gauze at least, and kindly held out her hand to
him, and said,</p>

<p>“Oh, how you are grown!”</p>

<p>“And so are you. Oh dear me, have you seen
her? Have you seen her?”</p>

<p>“Seen whom?” asked Amy, “my Aunt Eudoxia?
She is on there, by the ash&ndash;tree.”</p>

<p>“The Queen of Spain, Miss Rosedew, the Queen
of Spain fritillary! Oh, tell me which way she
went! If I lose her, I am done for!”</p>

<p>“Then, I fear, Master Garnet”&mdash;[“Confound
it,” thought Bob, “how all the girls do patronize
me!”]&mdash;“I am very much afraid you must make
up your mind to annihilation, if by the ‘Queen of
Spain’ you mean that common brown little butterfly
you wanted just now to kill so much.”</p>

<p>“Is she gone across the river, then? That is
nothing, I assure you. I would go through fire
after her. Oh, tell me, only tell me.”</p>

<p>Amy could not help laughing; poor Bob looked
so ridiculous, fitting a new net all the time upon
the ring of the old one, the crown of his hat come
to look for his head, his trousers kicked well up over
his boots, and his coat an undoubted ventilator.</p>

<p>“I really donʼt know,” said Amy; “how could
you expect me to see through your shrimp&ndash;net,
Master Garnet?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I beg your pardon&mdash;how stupid I am, to
be sure&mdash;I beg your pardon a thousand times;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
really I might have hurt you. I would not do that
for&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Even the Queen of Spain. To tell you the
truth, Master Garnet, if I knew where she was
gone I would not tell you, because I canʼt bear to
have things killed. In my opinion, it is so cruel.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Bob, a very long “oh,” drawn out
into half an ell; and he looked at Amy all the time
he was saying it, which was a wonderful thing for
him to do. Then it occurred to his mind, for the
first time possibly, what a beautiful creature she
was, more softly shaded than a Chalk&ndash;hill blue,
and richer than a cream&ndash;spotted tiger&ndash;moth! The
moment he felt this Bob was done for; Amy had
caught her captor.</p>

<p>Flushed as he was with the long hot chase, his
cheeks grew hotter and redder, as he got a dim
consciousness of a few of the things which he was
feeling. He was like a chrysalis, touched in the
winter, when it goes on one side from the crust of
the thorax, and sometimes can never get right
again. After having said “oh,” with emphasis
and so much diæresis, Bob did not feel called upon
for any further utterance till Amy was gone to her
Aunt Eudoxia; and then he contrived to say,
“Ah!” He was more put out than he had been
even when his pet poplar&ndash;hawk caterpillar was devoured
alive by ichneumon grubs. He went round
the tree ever so many times, and wondered what
was the matter with him, how he came there, and
what he was doing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Alas, poor Bob! Nature, who overlooks nothing,
was well aware of the difficulties when she cried,
“Jump up on my lap, Bob, and never be weaned
from me.” She knew that things of all sorts would
come between herself and her child, some of them
drawn from her own mother&ndash;milk, but most of
them from manʼs muzzling. Of the latter she had
not much fear with Bob; but the former, she
knew, were beyond her, and she had none but herself
to thank for them. She knew that the lad, so
strongly imbued with her own pleasant affluences,
was almost sure to be touched with that one which
comes from her breast the warmest. And then what
would become of zoology, phytology, entomology,
and all the other yard&ndash;long names which her
children spin out of her apron&ndash;strings?</p>

<p>While Bob was still fiddling with his fingers,
and forgetting all about butterflies, Miss Eudoxia,
fetched by Amy, came to hold discourse with him.</p>

<p>“Why, Master Robert, I do declare, Robert, my
butterfly boy! I have not seen you for such a time,
Robert.” And she held out her hand, which Bob
took with very little sense of gratitude. To be
called a “butterfly boy” before Amy, and Amy to
acquiesce in it!</p>

<p>“Ah, you think I have nothing for you, Robert.
You school&ndash;boys live upon suction. But just wait
a moment, my dear.”</p>

<p>She drew forth an old horn comfit&ndash;box, which
had belonged to her grandmother, and was polished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
up like amber from the chafing of many a lining.
This she opened with much ado, poured three
crinkled sugar&ndash;plums on her gloved palm, and a
smooth one as large as a hazel&ndash;nut, and offered
them all to Robert, with a smile of the finest
patronage.</p>

<p>“No, thank you, Miss Rosedew; no, thank you.
I am very much obliged to you.”</p>

<p>Miss Eudoxia had been wondering at her own
generosity, and thought that he was overcome with
it. So her smile became one of encouragement
and assurance against self&ndash;sacrifice.</p>

<p>“Oh, you need not be afraid, Robert. And you
can put some under your pillow, and wake up in
the night and suck them. How nice that will be,
to be sure! You see I know what boys are. And
I have plenty left for the infant&ndash;school. And
they donʼt deserve them as you do, Robin.”</p>

<p>“Miss Rosedew,” said Bob, in his loftiest
manner, though he was longing for them, only
that Amy was there; “you will believe me when I
assure you that I never touch sweets of any sort;
not even at a late dinner&ndash;party.”</p>

<p>Miss Eudoxia turned her eyes up, and almost
dropped the sugar&ndash;plums. But Amy, instead of
being impressed, merrily laughed, and said,</p>

<p>“Give them to me, then, auntie, please. Some
of the men at the night&ndash;school eat sweets after
early suppers.”</p>

<p>Bob said “good&ndash;bye” disconsolately, for he knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
that he had affronted Miss Doxy, without rising in
Amyʼs opinion. He forgot all about the gladiolus,
and let many great prizes escape him; for the day
was the last of the soft and sunny, which tempt
forth the forest denizens ere the frosty seal is set
on them. In the glimpses of every brown arcade,
in the jumbled gleam of the underwood, in the
alleys between the upstanding trees, even in the
strong light where the golden patches shone, and
the wood fell back to look at them, in all of these
he seemed to see and then to lose his angel. Her
face he could not see clearly yet, hard as he strove to
do it; affection is, but love is not, a photographic
power. Still he could see her shadowly; her attitude,
the fall of her hair, the manner of her
gestures; even the ring of her voice would seem
to dwell about the image. But he never got them
all together; one each time was the leading thing;
vague; and yet it went through him.</p>

<p>He made one attempt&mdash;for he feared from the
first, although he never could feel it so, that his love
was a thorough wild&ndash;goose chase&mdash;the poor boy
made one last attempt to catch at some other
pursuit.</p>

<p>“Father,” he said that very same night, after
sitting for hours of wandering, “will you give me
a gun and let me take to shooting?”</p>

<p>“A gun!” cried Bull Garnet, starting; “a gun,
Bob! What do you mean by it?”</p>

<p>“I meant nothing at all, father. Only I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the way to stuff birds, and there are some rare ones
here sometimes, and I want to make a collection.”</p>

<p>“Bob Garnet, as long as I am alive, you never
shall have a gun.”</p>

<p>“Then, will you lend me yours, father? I know
very well how to use it. I mean your patent&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Never, Bob. My son, if you love me, never
speak of it again.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="p2">When Miss Rosedew and her niece came in to
get ready for dinner, Amy cried out suddenly,
“Oh, only look at the roses, aunt; how they have
opened to&ndash;day! What delicious Louise Odier, and
just look at General Jacqueminot! and I do declare
Jules Margottin is finer than he was at
Midsummer. I must cut a few, for I know quite
well there will come a great frost if I donʼt, and
then where will all my loves be?”</p>

<p>Amyʼs prediction about the weather was as
random a guess as we may find in great authorities,
who are never right, although they give the
winds sixteen points of the thirty&ndash;two to shuffle in.
But it so turned out that the girl was right&mdash;a
point of the compass never hit till a day too late by
our weather&ndash;clerks.</p>

<p>That very same night such a frost set in as had
not been known in October for very nearly a century.
It lasted nine nights and eight days; twice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the mercury fell more than half way from the
freezing point to zero, and the grass was crisp in
the shade all day, though the high sun wiped off
the whiteness at noon wherever he found the way
to it. Boys rejoiced, and went mitching, to slide
on the pools of the open furzery: no boys since
the time of their great&ndash;grandfathers had done the
heel&ndash;tap in October. But the birds did not appreciate
it. What in the world did it mean? Why,
there were the hips not ripe yet, and the hollyberries
come to no colour, and half the blackberries
still too acid, and, lo! it was freezing hard enough
to make a worm cold for the stomach, even if you
could get him! Surely there was some stupid mistake
of two months in the piperʼs almanac. All
they could say was that, if it were so, those impudent
free&ndash;and&ndash;easy birds who came sponging on
them in the winter&mdash;and too stuck up, forsooth!
to live with them after sucking all the fat of the
land, and winning their daughters’ affections&mdash;those
outlandish beggars&mdash;be hanged to them&mdash;had got
the wrong almanac too.</p>

<p>Why, they had not even heard the chatter, the
everlasting high&ndash;fashion clack, of those jerk&ndash;tail
fieldfares yet; nor had a missel&ndash;thrush come swaggering
to bully a decent throstle that had sung
hard all the summer, just because his breast and
his coarse&ndash;shaped spots were bigger. Why, they
had not even seen a clumsy short&ndash;eared owl flopping
out of the dry fern yet&mdash;much good might it
do him, the fern that belonged to themselves!&mdash;nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
a single wedge of grey&ndash;lag geese, nor a woodcock
that knew his business. And those nasty dissolute
quacking mallards that floated in bed all day,
the sluggards, and then wouldnʼt let a respectable
bird have a chance of a good nightʼs roost&mdash;there
they were still on the barley&ndash;stubble; please God
they might only get frozen!</p>

<p>And yet, confound it all, what was the weather
coming to? You might dig, and tap, and jump
with both feet, and put your head on one side
in the most knowing manner possible, and get
behind a tuft of grass, and wait there ever so
long, and devil a worm would come up! And, as
for the slugs, oh, donʼt let me hear of them!
Though the thieves had not all got home yet,
they were ten degrees too cold for even an oyster&ndash;catcherʼs
stomach: feathers and pip, my dear
fellow! it gives me the colic to think of one.
Put your head under my wing, Jenny Wren; oh,
my darling, how cold your beak is!</p>

<p>Such, so far as I could gather them, were the
sentiments of the birds, and their confabulation,
when they went to roost, half an hour earlier than
usual&mdash;for bed is the warmest place after all; besides,
what was there to do?&mdash;on the 24th of
October, 1859. And they felt the cold rime settling
down on grey twig, and good brown leaf.
Yet some of the older birds, cocks of long experience,
buffers beyond all chaff, perked one eye at
the eastern heavens, before tucking it under the
scapular down&mdash;the eastern heavens all barred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
with murky red. Then they gave a little self&ndash;satisfied
tweedle, which meant to the ear of Melampus,</p>

<p>“Ah ha! an old bird like me knows something
about the weather! Bless my drumsticks and
merrythought, I shanʼt be so cold and hungry,
please God, this time to&ndash;morrow night.”</p>

<p>Oh you little wiseacres, much you know what
impendeth! A worse row than all the mallards
you grumble at could make in a thousand years
will spoil your roost to&ndash;morrow night. Think it a
mercy if you do not get your very feathers blown
off of you&mdash;ay, and the tree of your ancestors
snapped beneath your feet&mdash;before this time to morrow
night.</p>

<p>John Rosedew met the prettiest bird that ever
had nest in the New Forest, his own little duck of
an Amy, in the passage by the parlour&ndash;door, at
eight oʼclock in the morning of that 25th of October.
He kissed her white forehead lovingly,
according to early usage; then he glanced at the
weather&ndash;glass, and went nearer, supposing that his
short sight had cheated him.</p>

<p>“Why, Amy dear, you must have forgotten to
set the glass last night.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, papa. I set it very carefully.
You know I can do it as well as you can, since
you showed me the way. It was just a little
hollow last night, and I moved the Verrier scale
just a hundredth part of an inch downwards, and
then it was ten oʼclock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Then may the Lord have mercy on all seafaring
men, especially our poor boatmen, and the
dredging people off Rushford!”</p>

<p>Mr. Rosedew, as has been said before, was
parson of Rushford as well as of Nowelhurst. At
the former place he kept a curate, but looked
after the poor people none the less, for the distance
was only six miles; and now, as his legs
were getting stiff, he had bought Coræbus to
help him. Rushford lies towards the eastern end
of the great Hurst shingle bank, the most dangerous
part of Christchurch Bay, being fully exposed
to the south&ndash;west gales, and just in the run
of the double tide; in the eddy of the Needles.</p>

<p>“Why, what is the matter, papa? Even if it
rains, it wonʼt hurt them much. And itʼs as lovely
a morning as ever was seen, and the white frost
sparkling beautifully. What a magnificent sunrise!
Or, at least, a very strange one.”</p>

<p>“ʼSibi temperat unda carinis.’ All is smooth
for the present. But I heard the lash of the
ground&ndash;sea last night, when I lay awake. Fetch
my telescope, darling, and come with me to the
green room. We can see thence to St. Albanʼs
Head; but the danger is for those beyond it. All
the ships on this side of it will have time to work
up the Solent. Never before have I known the
mercury fall as it has done now. An inch and a
tenth in only ten hours!”</p>

<p>When they went to bed on the previous night,
the quicksilver stood at 30° 10´. Now it was at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
29°, and cupped like the bottom of a champagne
bottle, which showed that it still fell rapidly. But
as yet the silver of the frost was sparkling on the
lawn, and the morning sun looked up the heavens,
as if he felt all right. Nevertheless, it was but
show: he is bound to make the best of it, and, like
all other warm&ndash;hearted beings, sometimes has sorry
work there.</p>

<p>When they saw that no large craft had rounded
St. Albanʼs Head, only that the poor cement&ndash;dredgers
were working away at septaria, John and
his daughter went to breakfast, hoping that no
harm would be, while Miss Eudoxia lay in bed, and
reflected on her own good qualities.</p>

<p>Amy came out after breakfast, without any
bonnet or hat on, to make her own observations.
That girl so loved the open air, the ever glorious
concave, the frank palm of the hand of God&mdash;for
in cities we get His knuckles&mdash;that she felt as if
she had not bowed before her Friend and Maker,
the all&ndash;giving, the all&ndash;loving One, until she had
paid her orisons and sung her morning hymn with
His own ceiling over her. So now she walked beneath
the branches laden with His jewellery, and
over the ground hard&ndash;trodden by ministers doing
His will, and beside the spear and the flat&ndash;grass,
chilled with the awe of His breath, and among the
wailing flowers, wailing and black and shrivelled
up, because His face was cold to them.</p>

<p>For these poor Amy grieved sadly, for she was
just beginning to care again for the things whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
roots were outside of her. Lo the bright chrysanthemums,
plumed, reflex, and fimbriate; lo the
gorgeous dahlias, bosses quilled and plaited tight,
and wrought with depth of colour; and then the
elegant asters, cushioned, cochleate, praying only
to have their eyes looked into; most of all, her
own sweet roses, chosen flowers of the chosen
land&mdash;they hung their heads, and stuck together,
as brown as a quartered apple. Who could look
at them, who could think of them, and not feel as
if some of herself were dead?</p>

<p>Now, walking there, this youthful maiden,
fairest of all His works and purest, began to
observe, as He has taught us, the delicacies, the
pores, and glints of the grand universal footprint.
Not that the girl perceived one&ndash;tenth of the things
being done around her, any more than I can tell
them; for observation grows from as well as begets
experience; and the girlish mind (and the boyish
too, at any rate for the most part) has very lax
and indefinite communion with nature. How
seldom do we meet a lady who knows what way
the wind is! They all believe that it must freeze
harder when the sky is cloudy; not one in fifty
but trembles more at the thunder than at the
lightning.</p>

<p>Yet Amy, with true womanʼs instinct, being
alarmed for the lives of others, after her fatherʼs
prediction, looked around her narrowly. And first
her eyes went upwards, and they were right in
doing so. Of the sky she knew less than nothing&mdash;although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
herself well known there; but the
trees&mdash;come now, she was perfectly sure she knew
something about the trees. So you do, you
darling; and yet a very wee little; though more
than half the ladies do. You know an elm from
a wych&ndash;elm, and a hornbeam from a beech; and
what more can we expect of you?</p>

<p>The rime upon the dark tree&ndash;boles and the forward
push of the branches, the rime of white fur,
newly breathen but an hour ago, when a flaw from
the east came cat&ndash;like, and went through without
moving anything; this delicate down from the lips
of morning, silk work upon the night&ndash;fleece, was, as
all most beautiful is, the first to fleet and vanish.
Changing into a doubtful glister, which you must
touch to be sure of it, then trickling away into
beaded drops, like a tear which will have no denial,
it came down the older and harder rime, and perhaps
would bring that into its humour, and perhaps
would get colder and freeze again into little lumps,
like a tap leaking. Then the white face of the
rough pillared trunks, pearled with glistening
purity, was bighted into with scoops and dark bays,
like the sweep of a scythe in the morning. On the
bars of the gate, the silver harvest, spiked and
cropping infinitely, began to sheave itself away, and
then the sheaves were full ripe tears, and the tears
ran down if you thought of them.</p>

<p>But the notable sight of all, at least to a loitering
mind the most striking, was to see how the hoar&ndash;frost
gradually was lifting its light wing from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
grass. In little tufts and random patches&mdash;random
to us who know not why&mdash;the spangles, the spears,
and the crusted flakes, the fairy tinsel, the ermine
of dew, the very down of moonlight, the kiss of the
sky too pure for snow, and the glittering glance
of stars reflected&mdash;all this loveliness, caught and
fastened, by the nightʼs halourgic, in one broad
sheet of virgin white, was hovering off in tufts and
patches, as if a blind angel had breathed on it,
with his flight only guided by pity.</p>

<p>But through, and in, and between it all, the
boles of the trees, and the bars of the gate, the
ridge of the ruts, and dapples of lawn, one thing
Amy observed which puzzled her, for even she
knew that it was a thing against all usage. The
thaw was not on the south side or the south&ndash;east
side of anything, though the sickly sun was gazing
there; but the melting came from the north, and
took the frost aback. She wondered vainly about
it, but the matter was simple enough, like most of
the things which we wonder at, instead of at our
own ignorance. A flaw of warm air from the north
had set in; a lower warp which shot through and
threaded the cold south&ndash;eastern woof. This is not
a common occurrence. Since my vague, unguided,
and weak observations began, I have only seen it
thrice. And on each of those three times it has
been followed by a fearful tempest. Usually, a
frost breaks up with a shift of the wind to the
south&ndash;east, a gradual relaxing, a fusion of warmer
air, and a great effusion of damp, a blanket of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
clouds for the earth, and a doubt in the sky how to
use them. Then the doubt ends&mdash;as many other
doubts end&mdash;in precipitation. The wind chops
round to the west of south; the moisture condenses
outside our windows, instead of starring the inside;
and then come a few spits of rain. But the rain is
not often heavy at first, although it is stinging and
biting,&mdash;a rain which is half ashamed of itself, as
if it ought to be hail.</p>

<p>But, after all, these things depend on things we
cannot depend upon,&mdash;moods of the air to be multiplied
into humours of the earth and sea, and the
product traversed, indorsed, divided, touched, and
sliced at every angle by solar, lunar, and astral
influences.</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas.”</p>

<p class="p1">Lucky the man who knows when to take out
his umbrella.</p>

<p>That morning, the north wind crept along,
sponging the rime from the grass, and hustling it
rudely from the tree&ndash;sprays, on many of which the
black leaves draggled, frozen while yet in verdure.
Then the sky began to be slurred across with white
clouds breathing out from it, as a child breathes on
the blade of a knife, or on a carriage window.
These blots of cloud threw feelers out, and strung
themselves together, until a broad serried and serrate
bar went boldly across the heavens, from south&ndash;east
to north&ndash;west. It marked the point whence
the gale would begin, and the quarter where it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
would end. From this great bar, on either side,
dappled and mottled, like the wash of sepia on a
drawing, little offsets straggled away, and began to
wisp with a spiral motion, slow and yet perceptible.</p>

<p>This went on for an hour or two, darkening and
deepening continually, amassing more and more of
the sky, gathering vapours to it, and embodying as
it got hold of them; but still there was some white
wan sunshine through the mustering cloud&ndash;blots
and the spattering mud of the heavens; and still
the good folks who had suffered from chilblains,
and found it so much milder, exclaimed, “What a
beautiful day!”</p>

<p>Then about noon a mock sun appeared, feeble,
wild, and haggard, whose mates on the crown and
the east of the arc could scarcely keep him in
countenance. Over all this, and over the true sun
and the cirrhous outrunners, heavily drove at one
oʼclock the laden and leaden cumulus, blurred
on the outskirts with cumulostrate, and daubed
with lumps of vapour which mariners call “Noahʼs
arks.”</p>

<p>Then came the first sough of the wind, a long,
prolonged, deep&ndash;drawn, dry sob, a hollow and
mysterious sound, that shivered through the brown
leaves, and moaned among the tree&ndash;boles. Away
went every beast and bird that knew the fearful
signal: the deer lanced away to the holm&ndash;frith; the
cattle in huffs came belloking to the lew of the
boughy trees; the hogs ran together, and tossed
their snouts, and skittered home from the ovest;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the squirrel hied to his hollow dray, the weasel
slunk to his tuffet lair, and every rabbit skipped
home from grass. The crows and the magpies
were all in a churm; the heavy&ndash;winged heron
flapped off from the brook&ndash;side; the jar&ndash;bird flicked
out from the ivy&ndash;drum; the yaffingale darted across
the ride with his strange discordant laugh; even
the creepers that ply the trees crept into lichened
fastnesses, lay flat to the bark, and listened.</p>

<p>Nor less the solid, heavy powers that have to
stay and break the storm, no less did they, the
beechen clump, the funnelled glens, the heathery
breastwork, even the depths of forest night&mdash;whence
common winds shrink back affrighted&mdash;even
the bastions of Norman oak, scarred by many
a tempest&ndash;siege, and buckled by the mighty gale of
1703,&mdash;one and all they whispered of the stress of
heaven impending.</p>

<p>First came fitful scuds of rain, “flisky” rain they
call it, loose outriders of the storm, spurning the
soft ice, as they dashed by, and lashing the woodmanʼs
windows. Then a short dark pause ensued,
in which the sky swirled up with clouds, and the
earth lay mute with terror. Only now and then a
murmur went along the uplands.</p>

<p>Suddenly, ere a man might say, “Good God!”
or “Where are my children?” every tree was taken
aback, every peat&ndash;stack reeled and staggered, every
cot was stripped of its thatch, on the opposite side
to that on which the blow was expected.</p>

<p>The first squall of that great tempest broke from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the dark south&ndash;east. It burst through the sleet,
and dashed it upwards like an army of archers
shooting; ere a man could stay himself one way, it
had caught him up from another. The leaves from
the ground flew up again through the branches
which had dropped them; and then a cloud of all
manner of foliage, whirling, flustering, capering,
flitting, soared high over the highest tree&ndash;tops, and
drove through the sky like dead shooting&ndash;stars.</p>

<p>All that afternoon, the squalls flew faster, screaming
onward to one another, furious maniacs dashing
headlong, smiting themselves and everything. Then
there came a lull. So sudden that the silence was
more stunning than the turmoil. A pause for sunset;
for brave men countless to see their last of
sunlight. That evening, the sundown gun from
Calshot was heard over all the forest. I remember
to have expected fully that the next flaw of air
would come, like a heavy sigh, from the south&ndash;west.
The expectation showed how much I underrated
the magnitude of that broad stormʼs area. If the
wind had chopped then, it would have been only a
hard gale, not a hurricane.</p>

<p>Like a wave of the sea, it came on solidly, and
from the old direction; no squall, no blast, any
more; but one bodily rush of phalanxed air through
a chasm in the firmament. Black, and tossing
stone and metal as a girl jerks up her hat&ndash;plume,
it swept the breadth of land and sea, as bisons
horded sweep the snow&ndash;drifts, as Niagara sweeps
the weeds away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Where the full force of that storm broke, any
man must have been mad drunk who attempted to
go to bed. Houses unroofed, great trees snapped
off and flung into another tree, men caught like
chaff from the winnowing and dropped somewhere
in pond or gravel&ndash;pit, the carrierʼs van overthrown
on the road, and three oaks come down to lie upon
it,&mdash;some blown&ndash;away people brought news of these
things, and fetched their breath up to tell them.</p>

<p>Our own staunch hearths rocked under us, and
we looked for the walls to fall in upon us, as
every mad rush came plunging.</p>

<p>Miss Eudoxia sat with Amy, near the kitchen
fire; at least where the fire should have been,
but the wind had quenched it long ago. Near
them cowered Jemima and Jenny, begging not
to be sent to bed. They had crawled up&ndash;stairs
to see about it, and the floor came up to them&mdash;so
they said&mdash;like the shifting plate of the oven.
The parlour chimney&ndash;stack had fallen; but, in
Godʼs mercy, clear and harmless from the roof
of the house. No fear of the thatch taking fire:
that wind would have blown out the fire of
London.</p>

<p>Now as they sat, or crouched and sidled, watching
the cracks of the ceiling above, jumping every
now and then, as big lumps of mortar fell down
the chimney, and shrinking into themselves, every
time the great stack groaned and laboured
so, Miss Eudoxia, full of pluck, was reading
aloud&mdash;to little purpose, for she scarcely could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
hear her own voice&mdash;the prayers which are meant
to be used at sea, and the 107th Psalm. And
who shall say that she was wrong, especially as
the devil is supposed to be so busy in a gale of
wind?</p>

<p>Jemima and Amy were doing their best to
catch her voice at intervals. As for Jenny, she
did not care much what became of her now.
She knew at the last full moon that her sweetheart
was thoroughly up for jilting her; and
now when she had ventured out&mdash;purely of her
own self&ndash;will&mdash;the wind had taken her up anyhow,
and whisked her like a snow&ndash;flake against the
wash&ndash;house door. She was sure to have a black
eye in the morning, and then it would be all up
with her; and Jemima might go sweethearting,
and she could not keep her company.</p>

<p>The roar through the wood, the yells at the
corners, the bellowing round the chimneys, the
thunder of the implacable hurricane; any mortal
voice was less than a whisper into a steam&ndash;whistle.
Who could tell what trees were falling? A
monster might be hurled on the roof, and not one
of them would know it until it came sheer through
the ceiling. Amy was pale as the cinders before
her, but firm as the bars of iron, and even trying
to smile sometimes at the shrieks and queer turns
of the tempest. No candle could be kept alight,
and the flame of the parlour lamp quivered like a
shirt badly pinned on a washing&ndash;line. But Amy
was thinking dearly of the father of the household,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the father of the parish, out in the blinding wind
and rain, and where the wild waves were lashing.
And now and then Amy wondered whether it
blew so hard in London, and hoped they had no
big chimneys there.</p>

<p>John Rosedew had taken his little bundle, in a
waterproof case, and set out on foot for Rushford,
when the storm became unmistakeable. He would
not ride Coræbus; first because he would have
found it impossible to wipe him dry, secondly because
the wind has such purchase upon a man
when he is up there on the pommel. So the rector
strode off in his stoutest manner, an hour or so
before nightfall, and the rain went into him, neck
and shoes, before he got to the peat&ndash;rick. To a
resolute man, who feels sometimes that the human
hide wants tanning, there are few greater pleasures
than getting basted and cracklined by the wet wind;
only it must not come too often, neither last too
long.</p>

<p>So John was in excellent spirits, quelching along
and going pop like a ball of India&ndash;rubber, when he
came on a weaker fellow&ndash;mortal, stuck fast in a
chair of beech&ndash;roots.</p>

<p>“Why, Robert!” said Mr. Rosedew, and nine&ndash;tenths
of his voice went to leeward; “Robert, my
boy;&mdash;oh dear!”</p>

<p>That last exclamation followed in vain Johnʼs
favourite old hat, which every one in the parish
loved, especially the children. The hat went over
the crest of the hill, and leaped into an oak&ndash;tree,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
and was seen no more but of turtle&ndash;doves, who
built therein next summer, and for three or four
generations; and all the doves were blessed, for
the sake of the man who sought peace and
ensued it.</p>

<p>“Let me go after it,” cried Bob, with his knees
and teeth knocking together.</p>

<p>“To be sure I will,” replied John Rosedew&mdash;the
nearest approach to irony that the worst wind ever
took him&mdash;“now, Robert, come with me.”</p>

<p>He hooked the light stripling, hard and firm, to
his own staunch powerful frame, and, like a steamer
lashed alongside, forced him across the wind&ndash;brunt.
And so, by keeping the covered ways, by running
the grooves of the hurricane, they both got safe to
Rushford; to which achievement Bobʼs loving
knowledge of every inch of the forest contributed
at least as much as the stern strength of the
parson.</p>

<p>Pretty Bob had no right, of course, to be out
there at that time; but he had heard of a glorious
company of the deathʼs&ndash;head caterpillar, in a snug
potato&ndash;field, scooped from out the woodlands. He
knew that they must have burrowed now, and so
he set out to dig for them with his little handfork,
directly the thaw allowed him. Anything
to divert his mind, or rather revert it into the
natural channel. He had dreamed about sugar&ndash;plums,
and Amy, and butterfly&ndash;nets, and Queens of
Spain, and his father scowling over all, until his
brain, at that sensitive time, was like a sirex, trying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
to get out but stuck fast by the antennæ. Now,
Bob, though awake to the little tricks and pleasant
ways of Nature, as observed in cricks and crannies,
knew nothing as yet of her broader moods, her
purging sweeps, her clearances,&mdash;in a word, he
was a stranger to the law of storms. Therefore he
got a bitter lesson, and one which set him a thinking.
John Rosedew, with his grand bare head
bent forward to the wind&ndash;blow, and the grey locks
sweeping backward&mdash;how Amy would have cried!&mdash;towed
Bob Garnet down the combe which
spreads out to the sea at Rushford. The fall of
the waves was short and hard&mdash;no long ocean
rollers yet, only an angry beating surf, sputtering
under the gravel&ndash;cliff.</p>

<p>They found some shelter in the hollow, which
opens to the south&ndash;south&ndash;west; for, though it was
blowing as hard as ever, the wind had not canted
round yet; and the little village of Rushford, upon
which the sea is gaining so, was happy enough in
its “bunney,” and could keep its candles burning.</p>

<p>“Iʼll go home with the boy at sundown,
when the gale breaks, as I hope it will. His
father will be in a dreadful way, and I know what
that man is. But I could not leave the boy there,
neither could I go back again.”</p>

<p>So said John Rosedew, lulled by the shelter,
feeling as if he had frightened himself and all his
household for nothing; almost ashamed to show
himself at Octavius Pellʼs sea&ndash;cottage, the very
last dwelling of the village. But Octave Pell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
knew better. He had not lived upon that coast,
fagging out as a cricketer of the Church of England,
with his feet and his hands ready always,
and his spiked shoes holding the ground,&mdash;he had
not been on the outside of all things, hoping for
innings some day, without looking up at the skies
sometimes, and guessing about promotion. So he
knew that his rector, whom he revered beyond all
the fathers of men or women&mdash;for he too was soft
upon Amy&mdash;he saw that his rector was right in
coming, except for his own dear sake.</p>

<p>John came in, with his shapely legs stuck all
tight in the shrunk kerseymere (shrunk, and varnished,
and puckered like plaiting, from the pelt
of the rain), and by one hand still he drew
the quenched and welyy Bob. The wind was
sucking round the cliff, and the door flew open
hard enough for a weak manʼs legs to go with it.
But “Octave” Pell&mdash;as he was called, because he
would sing, though he could not&mdash;the Reverend
Octavius was of a sturdy order, well&ndash;balanced and
steady&ndash;going. He drew in his reeking visitors, and
dried, and fed, and warmed them; Bob being
lodged in a suit of clothes which he could only
inhabit sparsely. Then Pell laid aside his rose&ndash;root
pipe out of deference to his rector, and made
Bob drink hot brandy&ndash;and&ndash;water till he chattered
more than his teeth had done.</p>

<p>That curate was a fine young fellow, a B.A. of
John Rosedewʼs college, to whom John had given
a title for orders&mdash;not sold it, as some rectors do,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
for a twelvemonthʼs stipend. A tall, strong, gentlemanly
parson, stuck up in no wise, nor stuck
down; neither of the High nor Low Church rut,
although an improvement on the old type which
cared for none of these things. He did his duty
by his parish; and, as follows almost of necessity,
his parish loved and admired him. He never
lifted a poor manʼs pot&ndash;lid to know what he had
for dinner; he never made much of sectarian
squabbles, nor tried to exorcise dissent. In a word,
he kept his place, because he felt and loved it.</p>

<p>Only two rooms had Pell to boast of, but he was
wonderfully happy in them. He could find all his
property in the dark, and had only one silver spoon.
And the man who can be happy with one, was
born with it in his mouth. Those two rooms he
rented from old Jacob Thwarthawse, or rather
from Mrs. Jacob, for the old man was a pilot on
the Southampton Water, and scarcely home twice
in a twelvemonth. The little cot looked like a
boat&ndash;house at the bottom of the bunney; so close
it was to the high&ndash;water mark, that the froth of
the waves and the drifting skates’ eggs came almost
up to the threshold when the tide ran big, and the
wind blew fresh.</p>

<p>And in the gentle summer night&mdash;pray what is
it in Theocritus? John Rosedew could tell, but
not I&mdash;at least, I mean without looking&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppq6 p1">“Along the pinched caboose, on every side,<br />
With mincing murmur swam the ocean tide.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="p2">By the time Octavius Pell had clothed, and fed,
and warmed his drenched and buffeted guests, the
sun was slipping out of sight, and glad to be quit
of the mischief. For a minute or two, the cloud&ndash;curtain
lifted over St. Albanʼs Head, and a narrow
bar of lively green striped the lurid heavens. This
was the critical period, and John Rosedew was
aware of it, as well as Octave Pell. Either the
wind would shift to south&ndash;west quicker than vanes
could keep time with it, and then there would be
a lively storm, with no very wide area; or else it
would come on again with one impetuous leap and
roar, and no change of direction, and work to the
south&ndash;west gradually, blowing harder until it got
there. The sea was not very heavy yet, when they
went out to look at it; the rain had ceased altogether;
there was not air enough to move the fur of
a ladyʼs boa; but, out beyond the Atlantic offing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
ridges like edges of knives were jumping, as if to
look over the sky&ndash;line.</p>

<p>“Nulla in prospectu navis,” said John Rosedew,
who always talked Latin, as a matter of course,
when he met an Oxford man; “at least, so far as
I can see with the aid of my long&ndash;rangers.”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Pell, “and Iʼm heartily glad that
there is no ship in sight; for, unless Iʼm much
mistaken&mdash;run, sir, run like lightning. <i>Iʼve got no
more dry clothes.</i>”</p>

<p>They ran for it, and were just in time before
the fury came down again. Bob Garnet was ready
to slip away, for he knew that his father would be
wild about him; he had taken his drenched hat
from the firetongs, and was tugging at the latch
of the door. But now there was no help for it.</p>

<p>“We are in for it now,” cried Mr. Rosedew;
“I have not come down for nothing. It is, what
I feared this morning, the heaviest storm that has
broken upon us for at least a generation. And we
are not yet in the worst of it. God grant there be
no unfortunate ship making for the Needles. All
our boats, you say, Pell, are in the Solent long ago.
Bob, my boy, you must not expect to see your
father to&ndash;night. I hope he will guess what has
happened.”</p>

<p>The beach, or pebble bank of Hurst, is a long
and narrow spit of land, growing narrower every
year, which forms a natural breakwater to the frith
of the Solent. It curves away to the south of east
from the straighter and more lofty coast of Barton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Hordle, and Rushford. Hurst Castle, in which it
terminates, is the eastern horn of Christchurch Bay,
as Hengistbury Head is the western. The Isle of
Wight and the Needle Rocks protect this bay from
the east windʼs power, but a due south wind brings
in the sea, and a south&ndash;west the Atlantic. Off
this coast we see at times those strange floating
or rising islands known by the name of the
“Shingles;” which sometimes stay above water so
long, that their surface is clad with the tender
green of bladderwort and samphire; but more
often they disappear after taking the air for a few
short hours. For several years now they have
taken no air; and a boatman told me the other
day, that, from the rapid strides of the sea, he
thought it impossible for the “Shingles” ever to
top the waves again.</p>

<p>Up and down the Solent channel the tide pours
at a furious speed; and the rush of the strong ebb
down the narrows, flushed with the cross&ndash;tide from
St. Helenʼs, combs and pants out into Christchurch
Bay, above the floodmark of two hours since. This
great eddy, or reflux, is called the “double&ndash;tide;”
and an awkward power it has for any poor vessel
to fall into.</p>

<p>All that night it blew and blew, harder and
harder yet; the fishermenʼs boats on the beach
were caught up, and flung against the gravel&ndash;cliff;
the stout men, if they ventured out, were snatched
up as a mother snatches a child from the wheels of
a carriage; the oaks of the wood, after wailing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
howling, as they had done to a thousand tempests,
found that outcry go for nothing, and with it went
themselves. Seven hundred towers of Natureʼs
building showed their roots to the morning. The
old moon expired at O·32; and many a gap the
new moon found, where its mother threw playful
shadows. The sons of Ytene are not swift&ndash;witted,
nor deeply read in the calendar; yet they are apt
to mark and heed the great convulsions of nature.
The old men used to date their weddings from the
terrible winter of 1787; the landmark of the young
menʼs annals is the storm of 1859.</p>

<p>All that night, young Robert Garnet was strung
by some strange tension. Of course he could not
sleep, amid that fearful uproar, although he was
plunged and lost from sight in Octavius Pellʼs
great chair. The only luxury Pell possessed&mdash;and
that somehow by accident&mdash;was a deep, and soft,
and mighty chair, big enough for three people.
After one of the windows came in, which it did,
with a crash, about ten oʼclock, scattering Pellʼs
tobacco&ndash;jars, and after they had made it good with
books and boxes and a rug, so that the wind was
filtered through it, John Rosedew and his curate
sat on a couple of hard old Windsors, watching the
castle of Hurst. Thence would come the signal
flash, if any hapless bark should be seen driving
over the waters. There they sat, John Rosedew
talking, as he could talk to a younger man, when
his great heart was moved to its depth, and the
multitude of his mind in march, and his soul anticipating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
it: talking so that Octave Pell, following
his silver tones, even through that turmoil, utterly
forgot the tempest, and the lapse of hours, and let
fall on his lap the pipe, which John had made him
smoke.</p>

<p>The thunder of the billows waxing, for the wind
was now south&ndash;west, began to drown the roar of
the gale, and a storm of foam was flying, when
the faint gleam of a gun at sea was answered by
artilleryʼs flash from the walls of old Henry the
Eighth. Both men saw the landward light leap
up and stream to leeward; but only the younger
one descried the weak appeal from the offing.</p>

<p>“Where is she, Pell? Have you any idea?”</p>

<p>“She is away, sir, here to the right: dead in the
eye of the wind.”</p>

<p>“Then may our God and Father pity our brothers
and our sisters!”</p>

<p>Out ran both those strong good men, leaving
poor Bob (as they thought) asleep in the depth of
the easy&ndash;chair. The little cottage was partly sheltered
by an elbow of the cliff; otherwise it would
have been flying up the bunney long ago. The
moment the men came out of the shelter, they
were driven one against the other, and both
against the cliff.</p>

<p>“My castle will go at high&ndash;water,” said Pell,
though none could hear him; “but I shall be back
in time enough to get the old woman out.”</p>

<p>Then, as far as Pell could make out in the fierce
noise and the darkness, John Rosedew begged him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
to go back, while himself went on alone. For it
was Johnʼs especial business; he had procured the
lifeboat, chosen the crew, and kept the accounts;
and he thought himself responsible for any wreck
that happened. But what good on earth could
Pell do, and all his chattels in danger?</p>

<p>“No good, very likely,” Pell shouted, “and a
good deal perhaps in&ndash;doors! Keep the sea out with
a besom.”</p>

<p>Octave had a dry way with him, not only when
he sang, but when he thought he saw the right,
and did not mean to argue it. So rector and
curate, old man and young man, trudged along
together, each bending low, and throwing his
weight, like a quoit, against the wind; each stopping
and crouching at every tenth yard, as the
blast irresistible broke on them. Crusted with
hunks of froth pell&ndash;mell, like a storm of eggs on
the hustings, drenched by pelting sheets of spray,
deafened by the thundering surf, and often
obliged to fly with the wind from a wave that
rushed up scolloping, they battled for that scoop
of the bay where the ship must be flung by the
indraught.</p>

<p>Up to the present, Christchurch Point, and St.
Albanʼs Head beyond it, broke (as the wind was
westering) some little of the wildest sea&ndash;brunt.
But now they stood, or rather crouched, where the
mountain rollers gathering, sweeping, towering
onward, avalanche upon avalanche, burst on
their destined barrier. A thousand leagues of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
water, swelled by the whole weight of heaven
flung on it, there leaped up on the solid earth, and
to the heaven that vexed it. As a strong man in
his wrath accepts his wifeʼs endorsement, so the
surges took the minor passion of a fierce spring&ndash;tide,
rolled it in their own, and scorned the flat land they
looked down upon. Tush, the combing of their
crests was bigger than any town there. On they
came, too grand to be hurried even by the storm
that roused them; each had a quarter of a mile to
himself, and who should take it from him? The
white foam fell back in the wide water valleys,
and hissed and curdled away in flat loops, and the
storm took the mountain ridges again and swept
the leaping snow off. Anon, as it struck the
shelving shore, each rolling monster tossed its
crest unspeakably indignant; hung with impending
volume, curling like the scroll of God; then thundered,
as in judgment, down, and lashed the
trembling earth.</p>

<p>Among them, not a mile from shore, as the
breaking daylight showed it, heaved, and pitched,
and wallowed hog&ndash;like in the trough of waters, a
large ship, swept and naked. Swept of her masts,
of her canvas naked; but clad, alas! with men
and women, clustering, clinging, cowering from
the great white grave beneath them. As she laboured,
reeled, and staggered up to the storm&ndash;rent
heavens, and then plunged down the yawning
chasm, every attitude, every gesture of terror,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
love, despair, and madness could be descried on
the object&ndash;glass of the too&ndash;faithful telescope. As
a ghastly wan gleam from the east lit up all that
quivering horror, all that plight of anguish, John
Rosedew turned away in tears, and fell upon his
knees.</p>

<p>But Pell caught up the clear Munich glass,
blocked every now and then with foam; he wiped
it with his cuff, and levelled it on a stony ledge.
There he lay behind the pebbles, himself not out
of danger, unable to move, or look away, spellbound
by the awe of death in numbered moments
coming. Round him many a sturdy boatman,
gazing, listening, rubbing his eyes, wondering
about the wives and children of the brave men
there. The great disaster imminent was known
all over the village, and all who dared to cross the
gale had crept, under shelter, hitherwards. None
was fool enough to talk of boat, or tug, or lifeboat;
a child who had then first seen the sea must have
known better than that. The best ship in the
British navy could not have come out of the
Needles in the teeth of such a hurricane.</p>

<p>Some of the tars had brought their old Dollonds,
preventive glasses long cashiered, and smugglersʼ
night&ndash;rakers cheek by jowl, and every sort of “perspective,”
fifty years old and upward, with the
lenses cracked and rattling, and fungoid tufts in
the object&ndash;glass. Nevertheless, each man would
swear that his own glass was the best of the lot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and his neighbourʼs “not of much count.” To
their minds, telescopes like spectacles suit the
proprietor only.</p>

<p>“By Jove, I believe sheʼll do it!” cried Pell, the
chief interpreter, his glass being the only clear
one.</p>

<p>“Do what, sir? what?” asked a dozen voices,
hurriedly.</p>

<p>“Get her head round to windward, and swing
into smoother water. Theyʼre in the undertow
already. Oh, if they only knew it!”</p>

<p>They knew it, he saw, in a moment. They ran
up a spare sail, ere he could speak, to the stump of
the mizen&ndash;mast, and a score of brave men strained
on the sheets until they had braced them home.
They knew that it could not stand long; it would
fly away to leeward most likely when once they
mounted the wave&ndash;crest; but two or three minutes
might save them. With eight hands jamming the
helm up, and the tough canvas tugging and bellying,
the ship, with the aid of the undertow, plunged
heavily to windward. All knew that the ship herself
was doomed, that she never could fetch off
shore; but, if she could only hold her course for
some half&ndash;mile to the westward, she would turn the
flank of those fearful rollers, and a good stout boat
might live. For there a south&ndash;western headland
broke the long fury of the sea.</p>

<p>Every eye was intent, every bosom drew a deep
breath, as the next great billow rose under the
ship, and tossed her up to the tempest. They had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
brought her as near to the wind as they dared, so as
still to have steerage way on her, and she took the
whole force of the surge on her port bow, not on
her beam, as the people on shore had feared. The
sea broke bodily over her, and she staggered back
from the blow, and shook through every timber,
then leaped and lurched down the terrible valley,
but still, with the good sail holding. She was
under noble seamanship, that was clear to every
one, and herself a noble fabric. If she could but
surmount two billows more, without falling off
from the wind, within three points of which her
head lay, most of the crew might be rescued.
Already a stout galley, manned with ten oars, was
coming out of Christchurch Harbour, dancing like
a cork on the waves, though sheltered by the
headland.</p>

<p>Our ship rode over the next billow gallantly; it
was a wave that had some moderation, and the
lungs of the gale for the moment were panting,
just as she topped the comb of it. “Hurrah!”
shouted the men ashore; “By God, sheʼll do it
yet!”</p>

<p>By God alone could she do it. But the Father
saw not fit; the third billow was the largest of all
that had yet rolled up from the ocean. Beam&ndash;end
on she clomb the mountain, heeling over heavily,
showing to the shore her deck&ndash;seams,&mdash;even the
companion&ndash;finial, and the poor things clinging
there; a wail broke from them as the great sea
struck her, and swept away half a score of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nowʼs your chance, men. D&mdash;n your eyes!
She wonʼt hang there two minutes. Out with the
boats you&mdash;&mdash; lubbers. Look sharp, and be
d&mdash;d to you.”</p>

<p>The ancient pilot, Thwarthawse, dancing and
stamping, his blue jacket flapping in the wind, and
his face of the deepest plum colour, roared to windward
his whirlwind of oaths up an old split trumpet,
down which the wind came bellowing harder than
his voice went up it.</p>

<p>“Stow that, Jacob!” cried an old Scotchman,
survivor of many a wreck; “can ye nae see his
reverence, mon? Itʼs an unco thing for an auld
mon like you to swear at your mates in their
shrouds, chap. I ken the skipper of that there
ship, and heʼs no lubber, no more than I be.”</p>

<p>Sandy Macbride was known to fear God, and to
have fifty pounds in the savings bank. Therefore
no one flouted him.</p>

<p>“Youʼre right, Mac; youʼre right, by George!”
cried Pell. “What a glorious fellow! I can see
him there holding on by the stanchion, giving his
orders as coolly as if for the cabin dinner. I could
die with that man.”</p>

<p>The tear in Octavius Pellʼs right eye compelled
him to shift the glass a bit. He was just the man
who would have done even as that captain did.</p>

<p>“Hurrah, hurrah! theyʼve got the launch out;
only she and the gig are left. Troops on the deck,
drawn up in a line, and the women hoisted in first.
Give them three cheers, men, though they canʼt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
hear you! Three cheers, if you are Englishmen!
Glorious, glorious! There they go; never saw
such a fine thing in all my life. Oh, I wish I had
been a sailor!”</p>

<p>The tears ran down the young parsonʼs cheeks,
and were blown into the eyes of old Macbride; or
else he had some of his own.</p>

<p>“Shove off, shove off; nowʼs your time, for the
under&ndash;current is failing her. Both of them off, as
Iʼm alive; and yet a third boat I could not see.
What magnificent management! That man ought
to command a fleet. Two of them off for Christchurch
Harbour; away, away, while the wind lulls;
but what is the third boat doing?” Every one was
looking: no one answered. Old Mac knew what
it was, though his eyes were too old to see much.</p>

<p>“Captain Roberts, Iʼll go bail, at his old tricks
again. And thereʼs none with the sense to mutiny
on him, and lash his legs, as we did in the
<i>Samphire</i>.”</p>

<p>“At the side of the ship there is some dispute.
The boat is laden to the waterʼs edge, and the ship
paying off to leeward, for there is no man at the
wheel; there goes the sail from the bolt&ndash;ropes. If
they donʼt push off, ere an oarʼs length, they will
all be sucked into the rollers! Good God! now I
see what it is. There is only room for one more,
and not one of those three will take it. Two white&ndash;haired
men and a girl. Life against honour with
the old men; and what is life compared with it?
Both resolved not to stir a peg; now they join to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
make the girl go. Her father has got her in his
arms to pitch her into the boat; she clings around
his neck so that both must go, or neither. He
could not throw her; she falls on her knees, and
clings to his legs to die with him. Smack&mdash;there,
the rope is parted, and it is too late for further
argument. The troops in the boat salute the
officer, and he returns it as on parade.”</p>

<p>“Name of that ship?” said Jacob, curtly, to old
Sandy Macbride.</p>

<p>“<i>Aliwal</i>, East India trader, Captain Roberts.
Calcutta to Southampton.”</p>

<p>“Then itʼs all up now with the <i>Aliwal</i>, and
every soul on board of her.”</p>

<p>“Donʼt want a pilot to tell us that,” answered
old Mac, testily. “Youʼve seed a many good craft,
pilot, but never one as could last five minutes on
the Shingle Bank, with this sea running.”</p>

<p>“Ropes, ropes!” cried Octave Pell; “in five
minutes sheʼll be ashore here.”</p>

<p>“No, she ‘ont, nor yet in ten,” answered his
landlord, gruffly; “sheʼll fetch away to the eastward
first, now she is in the tide again, specially
with this gale on; and sheʼll take the ground over
yonner, and go to pieces with the next breaker.”</p>

<p>She took her course exactly as old Jacob mapped
it out for her. He knew every run and flaw of the
tide, and how it gets piled in the narrows by a very
heavy storm, and runs back in the eddy which had
saved so many lives there. This has nothing to do
with the “double tide;” that comes after high&ndash;water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
As the good ship traced the track of death,
doing as the waves willed (like a little boyʼs boat
in the Serpentine), the people on shore could see
those three, who had contested the right of precedence
to another world.</p>

<p>They were all upon the quarter&ndash;deck; and three
finer figures never yet came to take the air there,
in the weariness of an Indian voyage. Captain
Roberts, a tall, stout man, with ruddy cheeks and a
broad white beard, stood with his hands in his
pockets, and his feet asunder, and a sense of discipline
in his face, as of a man who has done his
duty, and now obeys his Maker. No sign of flinching
or dismay in his weather&ndash;beaten eyes, as he
watched his death roll towards him; though the
gazers fancied that one tear rose, perhaps at the
thought of his family just coming down&ndash;stairs at
Lymington. The military man beside him faced
his death quite differently; perhaps with even less
of fear, but with more defiance, broken, every now
and then, by anguish for his daughter. He had
not learned to fear the Lord, as those men do who
go down into the great deep. He looked as if he
ought to be commanding&ndash;officer of the tempest.
The ship, running now before wind and sea, darted
along as a serpent darts over the graves in the
churchyard; she did not lurch any more, or labour,
but rose and fell, just showing her fore&ndash;foot or
stern&ndash;post, as the billows passed under her. And
so that young maiden could stand and gaze, with
her fatherʼs arm thrown round her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>She was worthy to be his daughter; tall, and
light of form, and calm, with eyes of wondrous
brightness, she was looking at her fatherʼs face to
say the last good&ndash;bye. Then she flung both arms
around his neck, and fondly, sadly, kissed him.
Meanwhile the ship&ndash;captain turned away, and
thought of Susy Roberts. Suddenly he espied a
life&ndash;belt washed into the scuppers. He ran for it
in a moment, came behind the maid, and, without
asking her consent, threw it over her, and fastened
it. There was little chance of it helping her, but
that little chance she should have.</p>

<p>“Sheʼll take the ground next biller,” cried the
oracular Jacob; “stand by there with the ropes,
boys.”</p>

<p>On the back of a huge wave rose for the last
time the unfortunate <i>Aliwal</i>. Stem on, as if with
strong men steering, she rushed through the foam
and the white whirl, like a hearse run away with
in snow&ndash;drifts. Then she crashed on the stones,
and the raging sea swept her from taffrail to bowsprit,
rolled her over, pitched her across, and broke
her back in two moments. The shock rang through
the roar of billows, as if a nerve of the earth were
thrilling. Another mountain&ndash;wave came marching
to the roll of the tempest&ndash;drum. It curled disdainfully
over the side, like a fog sweeping over a
hedgerow; swoop&mdash;it broke the timbers away, as a
giant tosses a fir&ndash;cone.</p>

<p>“I canʼt look any longer,” cried Pell; “give me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
something to feel, men. Quick, there! I see
something!”</p>

<p>He seized the bight of a rope, and rushed anyhow
into the waters. But John Rosedew and the
life&ndash;boatmen held hard upon the coil of it, and drew
him with all their might back again. They hauled
Octavius Pell up in the manner of a cod&ndash;fish, and
he was so bruised and stupefied, that he could not
tell what he had gone for. They only saw floating
timber and gear, and wreck of every sort drifting,
till just for one sight&ndash;flash a hoary head, whiter
than driven waters, leaped out of the comb of the
billow. A naval man, or a military&mdash;who knows,
and to whom does it matter?</p>

<p>Brave men ashore, all waiting ready, dashed
down the steep of death to save him, if the great
wave should toss up its plaything. All Rushford
strained at the cables that held them from the
savage recoil. Worse than useless; the only
chance of it was to make more widows. The
sea leaped at those gallant strong men; there
were five on either cable; it leaped at them as the
fiery furnace leaped on the plain of Dura. It
struck the two ropes into one with a buffet, as a
lionʼs paw shatters a cobweb; it dashed the menʼs
heads together, and flung them all in a pile on a
ballast&ndash;heap. Lucky for them that it fought with
itself, and clashed there, and made no recoil. The
white&ndash;haired corpse was seen no more; and all
Rushford shrunk back in terror.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>The storm was now at its height; and of more
than a hundred people gathered on the crown of
the shore, and above the reach of the billows, not
one durst stand upright. Nearer the water the
wind had less power, for the wall of waves broke
the full brunt of it. But there no man, unless he
were most quick of eye and foot, might stand
without great peril. For scarcely a single billow
broke, but what, in the first rebound and toss, two
churning hummocks of surf met, and flashed up
the strand like a mad white horse, far in advance
of the rest. Then a hissing ensued, and a roll of
shingle, and the water poured huddling and lappeting
back from the chine itself had crannied.</p>

<p>As brave men fled from a rush of this sort, and
cowards on the bank were laughing at them, something
white was seen in the curl of the wave which
was breaking behind it. The ebb of that inrush
met the wave and partly took the crash of it, then
the white thing was shot on the shore like a pellet,
and lay one instant motionless. There was no
rope there, and the men hung back; John Rosedew
cried “Shame!” and ran for it; but they
joined hands across and stopped him. Before
they could look round again, some one had raised
the body. ‘Twas young Bob Garnet, and in his
arms lay the maiden senseless. She had looked at
him once, and then swooned away from the whirl,
and the blows, and the terror. No rope round his
body, no cork, no pad; he had rushed full into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the raging waves, as he woke from his sleep of
heaviness. He lifted the girl, and a bending giant
hung thirty feet above them.</p>

<p>Then a shriek, like a womanʼs, rang out on the
wind, and two great arms were tossed to heaven.
Bull Garnet stood there, and strove to rush on,
strove with every muscle, but every nerve strove
against it. He was balanced and hung on the
wind for a moment, as the wave hung over his
heartʼs love. Crash came the wave&mdash;what shriek
should stop it, after three hundred miles of
rolling?&mdash;a crash that rang in the souls of all
whom youth could move or nobleness. Nothing
was seen in the depth of water, the swirling, hurling
whiteness, until the billow had spent its onset,
and the curdle of the change was. Then Bob,
swept many a fathom in&ndash;shore, but griping still that
senseless thing, that should either live or die with
him&mdash;Bob, who could swim as well or better than
he could climb a tree, but felt that he and his load
were only dolls for the wave to dandle&mdash;down he
went, after showing his heels, and fought the
deadly outrush. None but Natureʼs pet would
have thought of, none but the favoured of God
could have done, it. He felt the back&ndash;wave
tugging at him, he felt that he was going; if
another billow broke on him, it was all up with
his work upon wire&ndash;worm. Holding his breath,
he flung his right leg over the waist of the maiden,
dug his two hands deep into the gravel, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
clapped his feet together. Scarcely knowing what
was up, he held on like grim death for life, and
felt a barrowload of pebbles rolling down the
small of his back. Presently he saw light again,
and sputtered out salt water, and heard a hundred
people screaming out “Hurrah!” and felt a strong
arm thrown round him&mdash;not his fatherʼs, but John
Rosedewʼs. Three senseless bodies were borne to
the village&mdash;Bull Garnetʼs, and Bobʼs and the
maidenʼs.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="p2">Meanwhile that keen engineering firm, wind,
wave, and tide, had established another little business
on the coast hard by. This was the general
wreck and crack&ndash;up of the stout Pell&ndash;castle, a proceeding
unnoticed by any one except good mother
Jacob, whose attention was drawn to it forcibly, as
the head of the bed fell in upon her. Thereupon
the stout dame made a rush for it, taking only her
cat and spectacles, and the little teapot of money.
As she started at a furious pace, and presented to
the elements a large superficial area, the wind
could not resist the temptation, but wafted her to
the top of the bunney, without her feet so much as
once a&ndash;touching the blessed earth&mdash;she goes mad
if any one doubts it&mdash;and planted her in a white&ndash;thorn
tree, and brought an “elam” of thatch to
shelter her from her own beloved roof. There,
when the wind subsided, she was happily discovered
by some enterprising children; the cat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
was sitting at her side; in one blue hand she held
her specs, and in the other a teapot.</p>

<p>Poor Pellʼs easy&ndash;chair was thrown up, three
miles to the westward, in the course of the next
spring&ndash;tides, and, being well known all over the
neighbourhood (from his lending it to sick people),
was brought to him, with a round of cheers, by
half a dozen fishermen. They refused the half&ndash;crown
he offered them, and displayed the greatest
anxiety lest his honour should believe it was them
as had taken the shine off. The workmanship not
being modern, the chair was little the worse for its
voyage; only it took six months to dry, and had a
fine smell of brine ever afterwards. Then, having
been lent to an old saltʼs widow, it won such a
reputation, all across the New Forest, as a specific
for “rheumatics in the small of the back,” that
old women, having <i>no</i> small to their backs, walked
all the way from Lyndhurst, “just to sot themselves
down in it, and how much was to pay,
please, for a quarter of an hour?” “A shilling,”
said Octave Pell, “a shilling for the new lifeboat
that lives under Christchurch Head.” Then they
pulled out mighty silver watches, and paid the
shilling at the fifteen minutes. The walk, and
the thought of the miracle, and the fear of making
fools of themselves, did such a deal of good, that a
man got up a ‘bus for it; but Pell said, “No;
none who come by ‘bus shall sit in my chair of
ease.”</p>

<p>The greedy sea returned brave Pell no other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
part of his property. His red tobacco&ndash;jar, indeed,
was found by some of the dredgemen three or four
years afterwards, but they did not know it was his,
and sold it&mdash;crusted as it was with testacea, and
ribboned with sea&ndash;weed&mdash;to the zealous secretary
of&mdash;I wonʼt say what museum. “Roman, or
perhaps Samian, or possibly Ph&oelig;nician ware,”
cried the secretary, lit with fine&mdash;though, it may
be, loose&mdash;ideas; and he catalogued it: “Ph&oelig;nician
in the opinion of an F.A.S. There is every
reason to believe it a vase for Thuricremation.”
“Hollo!” cried Pell, when he went there to lecture
upon cricket as played by Ulysses, “why, Iʼm
blessed if you havenʼt got&mdash;&mdash;” “The most undoubted
Ph&oelig;nician relic contained in any museum!”
So he laughed with other peopleʼs cheeks,
like a man of sense.</p>

<p>All the folk of Rushford, and many too of
Nowelhurst, contributed to a secret fund for refurnishing
Octavius Pell. So great were the
mystery and speed, and so clever the management
of the dissenting parson, that two great vans were
down upon Pell before he had heard a word of it.
He stood at the door of the cobblerʼs shop, and
tried to make a speech; but the hurrahs were too
many for him, and he turned away and cried.
Tell me that any man in England need be anything
but popular who has a heart of his own, and
is not ashamed of having it!</p>

<p>At the Crown, where the three sick people were,
a very fine trade was doing; but a finer one still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
upon the beach, as the sea went down and the
choice contents of the <i>Aliwal</i> came up. For that
terrible storm began to abate about noon on the
26th. It had blown as hard for twenty&ndash;four hours
as it ever does blow in any land, except in the gaps
of the Andes and during cyclones of the tropics.
Now the core of the storm had no more cells in it;
and the puffs that came from the west and north&ndash;west,
and so on till it got to the pole&ndash;star, were
violent indeed, but desultory, and seemed not to
know where they were going. Finally, about midnight,
the wind owned that its turn was over, and
sunk (well satisfied with its work) into the arms
of slumber&mdash;“placidâque ibi demum morte quievit.”
And its work had been done right well. No English
storm since the vast typhoon of 1703&mdash;which
I should like to write about some day if my little
life&ndash;storm blows long enough&mdash;had wrought such
glorious havoc upon that swearing beaver, man.
It had routed his villages at the Landʼs End, and
lifted like footstools his breakwater blocks; it had
scared of their lives his Eddystone watchmen, and
put out half his lighthouses; it had broken upon
his royalty, and swept down the oaks of the New
Forest; it had streaked with wrecks the Goodwin
Sands, and washed ships out of harbours of refuge;
it had leaped upon London as on a drain&ndash;trap, and
jarred it as a man whistles upon his fingers; it had
huddled pell&ndash;mell all the coal&ndash;trade;&mdash;saddest
vaunt (though not the last), it had strewn with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
gashed and mangled bodies (like its own waves,
countless) the coasts of Anglesea and Caernarvon.</p>

<p>On the morning now of the 27th, with the long
sullen swell gold&ndash;beater&ndash;skinned by the recovering
sun, the shingle&ndash;bank was full of interest to an
active trader. They had picked up several bodies
with a good bit of money upon them, and the
beach was strewn with oranges none the worse for
a little tossing. For the stout East Indiaman
<i>Aliwal</i> had touched at the Western Islands, and
taken on board a thousand boxes of the early
orange harvest. And not only oranges were rolling
among the wrack, the starfish, the sharkʼs teeth,
and the cuttle&ndash;eggs, but also many a pretty thing,
once prized and petted by women. There were
little boxes with gilt and paint, sucked heartily by
the salt water, and porcupine&ndash;quills rasping up
from panels of polished ebony, cracked mirrors
inside them, and mother&ndash;of&ndash;pearl, and beading of
scented wood; all the taste and the labour of man
yawning like dead cockles, crimped backward,
sodden and shredded, as hopeless a wreck as a
drunkard.</p>

<p>Then there were barrels, and heavy chests,
planking already like hemp in the prison&ndash;yard,
bulkheads, and bulwarks, and cordage, and reeve&ndash;blocks,
and ten thousand other things, well appreciated
by the wreckers, who were hauling them up
the bunneys; while the Admiralty droitsmen made
an accurate inventory of the bungs and the blacking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
bottles. Some of the sailors, and most of the
passengers, who had escaped in the boats to Christchurch,
came over to look for anything that might
turn up of their property. Hereupon several
fights ensued, and many poor fellows enjoyed opportunity
for a closer inspection of the Rushford stratum
than the most sanguine of their number
anticipated; until the police came down in force,
and extinguished at once all other rights of salvage
except their own.</p>

<p>Nevertheless there was yet one field upon which
the police could not interfere; although Jack
wished for nothing better than to catch the lubbers
there. This was Jackʼs own domain, the sea,
where an animated search was going on for the
body of Colonel Nowell. His servant had hurried
from Christchurch to Nowelhurst to report the
almost certain death of Sir Cradockʼs only brother.
He did not go first to ascertain it; for the road
along the cliffs was impassable during the height
of the storm. Sir Cradock received the announcement
with very few signs of emotion. He had
loved that Clayton in early youth, but now had
almost forgotten him; and Clayton had never kept
his brother at all apprised of his doings. Sir Cradock
had gone into mourning for him, some three
years ago; and Colonel Nowell never took the
trouble to vindicate his vitality until Dr. Huttonʼs
return. And, even though they had really
known and loved one another as brothers, the loss
would have been but a tap on the back to a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
already stabbed through the heart. Therefore Sir
Cradockʼs sorrow exploded (as we love to make our
griefs do, and as we so often express them) in the
moneyed form. “I will give 500<i>l.</i> to the man who
finds my poor brotherʼs body.”</p>

<p>That little speech launched fourteen boats.
What wrecker could hope for anything of a tenth
part of the value? Men who had sworn that they
never would pull in the same boat again together&mdash;might
the Great Being, the Giver of life, strike
them dead if they did!&mdash;forgot the solemn perjuration,
and cried, “Give us your flipper, Ben; after
all, there are worse fellows going than you, my
lad:” and Ben responded, “Jump into the starn&ndash;sheets;
you are just the hand as we want, Harry.
Manyʼs the time Iʼve thought on you.” Even
the dredging smacks hauled in&ndash;shore from their
stations, and began to dredge for the Colonel;
till the small boats resolved on united action,
tossed oars, and held solemn council. Several
speeches were made, none of them very long, but
all embodying that fine sentiment, “fiat justitia,
ruat c&oelig;lum,” in the form of “fair play, and be
d&mdash;d to you.” Then Sandy Mac, of the practical
mind, made a suggestion which was received with
three wild rounds of cheers.</p>

<p>“Give ‘em a little ballast, boys, as they be come
in&ndash;shore to dredge for it.”</p>

<p>With one consent the fourteen boats made for
the shore, like the fleet of canoes described by the
great Defoe. Nor long before each shallopʼs nose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
“grated on the golden sands.” The men in the
dredging smacks looked at the sky to see if a squall
was coming. And soon they got it, thick as hail,
and as hot as pepper. The fourteen boats in
battle array advanced upon them slowly, only two
men rowing in each, all the rest standing up, and
every man charged heavily. When they were at a
nice wicket distance, old Mac gave the signal, and
a flight of stones began, which, in the words of
the ancient chroniclers, “well&ndash;nigh darkened the
noonday sun.” The bravest dredger durst not
show his head above the gunwale; for the Rushford
stones are close of grain, and it is sweeter to
start than to stop them. As for south&ndash;westers and
dreadnoughts, they were no more use than vine&ndash;leaves
in a storm of electric hail.</p>

<p class="phq p1">“Ah, little then those mellow grapes their vine&ndash;leaf shall avail,</p>
<p class="phn">So thickly rattles on <i>the tiles</i> the pelting of the hail.”</p>
<p class="pr4"><i>Georg.</i> i. 448.</p>

<p class="p1">The dredgers gave in, and hoisted a shirt as
a signal for a parley. The Rushford men refused
to hear a syllable about “snacks.” What they
demanded was “unconditional surrender;” and the
dredgers, having no cement&ndash;stones on board, were
compelled to accept it. So they took up their bags,
and walked the smacks off three miles away to
their station, with very faint hopes indeed that the
obliging body might follow them. The boatmen
celebrated their victory with three loud cheers for
Sandy Mac, and a glass of grog all round. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
they returned to the likeliest spot, and dragged
hard all the afternoon.</p>

<p>“Tarnation ‘cute body,” cried Ben, “as ever I
come across. Whoʼd a thought as any perfessing
Christian would have stuck to Davy Jonesʼs locker,
and refooged the parson and clerk so? Spit on
your grapples, my lads of wax, and better luck the
cast after.”</p>

<p>“The Lord kens the best,” replied Sandy Mac,
with a long&ndash;drawn sigh, “us poor vessels canna do
more than is the will of the Lord, boys. Howsomever,
I brought a bit of bait, a few lug&ndash;worms,
and a soft crab or two; and please the Lord Iʼll
rig my line out, and see if the bass be moving.
And likely there may be a tumbling cod on the
run speering after the puir bodies. Ah, yes, the
will of the Lord; we ates them, and they ates us.”</p>

<p>The canny old Scotchman, without foregoing
his share in the general venture&mdash;for he helped to
throw the grapnels, or took a spell at the rudder&mdash;rigged
out a hook on his own account, and fastened
the line to the rowlocks.</p>

<p>“Fair play, my son,” cried Ben, winking at his
comrades; “us go snacks in what you catch, mind.
And the will of the Lord be done.”</p>

<p>“Dinna ye wish ye may get it?”&mdash;the old man
glowered at him indignantly&mdash;“Iʼll no fish at all
on that onderstanding.”</p>

<p>“Fish away, old boy, and be blessed, then. I
see he ainʼt been in the purwentive sarvice for nothing.
But Iʼm blowed if heʼll get much supper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Harry, if itʼs all to come off that darned old hook.”
They all laughed at old Mac, who said nothing,
but regarded his line attentively.</p>

<p>With many a joke and many an oath, they toiled
away till the evening fog came down upon the
waters. Then, as they turned to go home, old Mac
felt a run upon his fishing&ndash;gear. Hand over hand
he began to haul in, coiling the line in the stern&ndash;sheets.</p>

<p>“Itʼs a wapping big fish, as ever I feel, mates;
na, na, yeʼll no touch it, or yeʼll be claiming to
come and sup wi’ me. And deil a bit&mdash;the Lord
forgive me&mdash;will ye haʼ, for grinning at an auld
mon the likes of that, I tell ye. Lord ha’ mercy
on me, a wake and sinful crater!”</p>

<p>They all fell back, except Macbride, as before
them in the twilight rose the ashy grey face and
the long white hair of Colonel Clayton Nowell.</p>

<p>Mac stuck to his haul like a Scotchman; to him
the main chance was no ghost. Many a time has
he told that story, and turned his quid upon it,
cleverly raining between his teeth with fine art to
prolong the crisis.</p>

<p>The line being his, and the hook being his, and
the haul of his own hands only, Sandy Mac could
never see why he should not have all the money.
The question came close to litigation; but for that,
except as a word of menace, Mac was a deal too
wide awake. He compounded at last for 300<i>l.</i> and
let the other four share the residue.</p>

<p>So poor Colonel Nowellʼs countenance, still looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
grand and dignified, was saved from the congers
and lobsters; and he sleeps close by his nephew
and namesake in Nowelhurst churchyard. The
body of Captain Roberts was found a long way up
the Solent. He had always carried a weather helm,
and shaped a good course for harbour. May they
rest in peace!</p>

<p>I have no doubt that Captain Roberts so rests,
and am fain to believe, in the mercy of God, the
same of the brave old Colonel. At least, we will
hope that he is not gone to that eternal punishment,
whose existence our divines contend for in a
manner so disinterested. He had been a harum&ndash;scarum
man; and now, having drowned and buried
him, we may enter upon his history with the charity
due to both quick and dead, but paid to the latter
only.</p>

<p>A soldier is, in many things, by virtue of his
calling, a generous, careless man. We have always
credited the sailor with these popular qualities;
hornpipes, national drama, and naval novels imbuing
us. I doubt if the sailor be, on the whole,
so careless a man as the soldier. Jack is obliged,
by force of circumstance, to bottle up his money,
his rollicksomeness and sentimentality, and therefore
has more to get rid of, when he comes ashore
once in a twelvemonth. But spread the outburst
over the year, strike the average of it, and the
rainfall at Aldershot will equal that at Portsmouth.</p>

<p>Only by watching the Army List&mdash;which at
length he was tired of doing&mdash;could the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
brother tell if the Indian brother were living.
Even the most careful of us begin to feel that
care is too much for the nine lives of a cat, when
Fahrenheit scores 110° in the very coolest corner,
and the punkah is too hot to move. So, after one
or two Griffin letters, full of marvels which the
writer pretended not to marvel at, a silence, as of
the jungle, ensued, and Sir Cradock thought of
tigers. Then the slides of his own life began to
move upon him; and less and less every year he
thought of the boy who had laughed and cried with
him.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Nowell was ordered suddenly to the
borders of the Punjaub, and for twenty years his
brother Cradock drank his health at Christmas,
and wondered how about the Article against praying
for the dead. The next thing he heard, though
it proved his own orthodoxy, disproved it by making
him swear hard. Clayton Nowell had married;
married an Affghan woman, to the great disgust
of his brother officers, and the furious disdain of
her kinsmen. A very fine family of Affghan chiefs
immediately loaded their fusils, and swore to shoot
both that English dog and their own Bright Eyes
of the Morning.</p>

<p>“To think,” cried Sir Cradock Nowell, “that
a brother of mine should disgrace himself, and
(what matters far more) his family, by marrying a
wretched low Affghan woman!”</p>

<p>“To think,” cried Mohammed Khans, “that a
sister of ours should disgrace herself, and (what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
matters far more) her family, by marrying a cursed
low English dog!”</p>

<p>Which party was in the right, judge ye who
understand the matter. The officers’ wives got
over their prejudice against Bright Eyes of the
Morning, and matronised, and petted, and tried to
make a Christian of her. Captain Nowell adored
her; she was so elegant in every motion, so loving,
and so simple. She quite reformed him for the time
from his too benevolent anthropology, from the
love of dice, and the vinous doings which the
Prophet does not encourage.</p>

<p>But the poor thing died in her first confinement,
while following her husbandʼs regiment at the foot
of the Himalayah, leaving her new&ndash;born babe to
the care of a faithful Affghan nurse, who had kept
at her dear ladyʼs side, even among the infidels.
This good nurse, being great of soul, and therefore
strong of faith, could not bear that the child of her
mistress, the highest blood of the Affghans, should
become a low Frank idolater. So she set off with
it, in the dark night, crouching past the sentinels,
thieves, and other camp followers, and trusted herself
to the boundless jungle, with only the stars to
guide her. She put the wailing child to her breast,
for her own dear babe was dead, and hushed it
from the vigilant ears of the man&ndash;eating tiger.
Then off again for Affghanistan, six hundred miles
in the distance.</p>

<p>How this wonderful woman, soothing and coaxing
the little stranger (obtrusively remarkable for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the power of her squalls), how she got on through
the thorns, the fire, the famine, the jaws of the
tiger, and, worse than all, the pestilent fever,
bred from the rich stagnation of that alluvial soil,
is more than I, or any other unversed in womanʼs
unity, may pretend to show. Enough that with her
eyes upon the grand religious heights&mdash;heathen high
places, we should call them&mdash;she struggled along
through nearly three&ndash;quarters of her pilgrimage,
and then she fell among robbers. A villanous hill&ndash;tribe,
of mixed origin, always shifting, never working,
never even fighting when they could run away,
hated and despised by the nobler mountain races,
the pariahs of the Himalayah, ignorant of any good,
debased as any Africans&mdash;in a single word, Rakshas,
or worshippers of the devil. A nice school of education
for a young lady of tender years&mdash;or rather
months&mdash;to commence in.</p>

<p>The nurse was allotted to one of their chiefs, and
the babe was about to be knocked on the head,
when it struck an enlightened priest that in two
years’ time she would make a savoury oblation to
the devil; so the Affghan woman was allowed to
keep her, until she began to crawl about among
the dogs and babes of the station. Here she so
distinguished herself by precocious skill in thieving,
that her delighted owner conferred upon her the
title of “Never&ndash;spot&ndash;the&ndash;dust,” and even instructed
her how to steal the high priestʼs knife of sacrifice.
That last exploit saved her life. Such a genius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
had never appeared in any tribe of the Rakshas
until this great manifestation.</p>

<p>So “Never&ndash;spot&ndash;the&ndash;dust” was well treated, and
made much of by her owner, to whom she was
quite a fortune; and soon all the band looked up
to her as the future priestess of the devil. For ten
years she wandered about with them, becoming
every year more important, proud that none could
approach her skill in stealing, lying, and perjury,
utterly void of all religion, except the few snatches
of Moslemism which her nurse had contrived to
impart, and the vague terror of the evil spirit to
whom the wild men paid their vows. But, when
she was ten years old, a tall and wonderfully active
child, and just about to be consecrated by the blood
of inferior children, a British force drew suddenly
all around the nest of robbers. Of late the scoundrels
had done things that made John Bullʼs hair
stand on end; and, when his hair is in that condition,
sparks are apt to come out of it.</p>

<p>Seeing no chance of escape, and having very
faint hopes of quarter, the robbers fought with a
bravery which quite astonished themselves; but the
evil spirit was against them&mdash;a rare inconsistence
on his part. Their rascally camp was burnt,
which they who had burned some hundreds of villages
looked upon as the grossest cruelty, and
more than half of their number were sent home to
their patron and guardian. Then the Affghan
nurse, so faithful and so unfortunate, fled from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the burning camp with her charge, fell before the
British colonel, and poured forth all her troubles.
The Englishman knew Major Nowell, and had
heard some parts of his history; so he took “Never&ndash;spot&ndash;the&ndash;dust”
to her father, who was amazed at
once and amused with her. She could run up the
punkah, and stand on the top, and twirl around on
one foot; she could cross the compound in three
bounds; she could jump upon her fatherʼs shoulder,
and stay there with the spring of her sole; she
could glide along over the floor like a serpent, and
hold on with one hand to anything. And then her
most wonderful lightness of touch; she had fully
earned her name, she could brush the dust without
marking it. She could come behind her fatherʼs
back, crawling over the table, and fasten his sword&ndash;hilt
to his whiskers, without his knowing a thing of
it. She could pick all his pockets, of course; but that
was too rude an operation for her to take any delight
in it. What she delighted to do, and what even she
found difficult, was to take off his shoes and stockings
without his being aware of it. It was a beautiful
thing to see her: consummate skill is beautiful, in
whatever way it is exercised. The shoe she could
get off easily enough, but the difficulty was with
the stocking; and there the chief difficulty was
through the sensitiveness of the skin, unaccustomed
to exposure. Though she had never heard of temperature,
evaporation, or anything long, her genius
told her the very first time where the tug was and
how to meet it. Keeping her little cornelian lips&mdash;lips
which you could see through&mdash;just at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
proper distance, she would breathe so softly upon
the skin that the breath could not be felt, as inch
by inch she lowered down the thin elastic covering.
Then she would jump up out of the ground, and
shout into his ears, with a voice of argute silver&mdash;</p>

<p>“Faddery, will ‘oo have ‘oor shoe? Fear to go
wiyout him?”</p>

<p>She began to talk English, after a bit; and the
weather beaten Colonel&mdash;for now he had got that
far&mdash;who had never looked upon any child, except
as one rupee per month&mdash;thinking of his beloved
Bright Eyes of the Morning, who might, with the
will of God, have made a first&ndash;rate man of him,
only she was too good for him,&mdash;thinking of her,
and seeing the gleam of her glorious eyes in her
child, he loved that child beyond all reason, and
christened her “Eoa.”</p>

<p>He never took to bad things again. He had
something now in pledge with God; a part of himself
that still would live, and love him when he
was skeleton. And that, his better part, should
learn how lying and stealing do not lead to the
right half of the other world.</p>

<p>His ideas about that other world were as dormant
as Eoaʼs; but now he began to think about
it, because he wanted to see her there. So, with
lots of tears, not only feminine, Eoa Nowell was
sent to the best school in Calcutta, where she
taught the other young ladies some very odd things
indeed.</p>

<p>Wherever she went, she must be foremost;
“second to none” was her motto. Therefore she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
learned with amazing quickness; but it was not
so easy to unlearn.</p>

<p>Then arose that awful mutiny, and the Colonel
at Mhow was shot through the neck, and let lie,
by his own soldiers. His daughter heard of it, and
screamed, and no walls ever built would hold her.
All the way from Calcutta, up the dreary Ganges,
she forced her passage, sometimes by boat, sometimes
on her weariless feet.</p>

<p>She had never cared much for civilization, and
loved every blade of the jungle. The old life
revived within her, as she looked upon the broad
waters, and the boundless yellow tangle, wherein
glided no swifter thing, nothing more elegant, than
herself.</p>

<p>She found her darling father in some rude cantonment,
prostrate, helpless, clinging faintly to the
verge of death. Dead long ago he must have been
but for Rufus Hutton; and dead even now he
would have been but for his daughterʼs presence.
His dreamy eyes went round the hut to follow her
graceful movements; she alone could tend the
wounds as if with the fall of gossamer, she alone
could soothe and fan the intolerable aching.
They looked into each otherʼs eyes and cried
without thinking about it.</p>

<p>Then, as he gradually got better, and the surge
of trouble passed them, Eoa showed for his amusement
all her strange accomplishments. She had
not forgotten one of them in the grand school at
Calcutta. They had even grown with her growth,
and strengthened with her strength.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>She would leap over Rufus Huttonʼs head like a
flash of light, and stand facing him, without a
muscle moving, and on his back would be a land&ndash;crab;
she would put his up&ndash;country hat on the
floor, and walk on one foot round the crown of it;
she would steal his case of instruments, and toss
them in the air all open, and catch them all
at once.</p>

<p>By her nursing and her loving, her stealing and
her mockery, she won Dr. Huttonʼs heart so entirely
that he would have proposed to her, had she
only been of marriageable age, or had come to
think about anything.</p>

<p>Then they had all to cut and run, with barely
three hours’ notice, for the ebb of the rebellion
swept through that district mightily. Eoa went to
school again, and her father came to see her daily,
until he was appointed to a regiment having something
more than name and shadow.</p>

<p>Now Eoa, having learned everything that they
can teach in Calcutta, the Himalayah, or the
jungle, was coming to England to receive the down
and crown of accomplishments. Who could tell
but what they might even teach her affectation?
Youth is plastic and imitative; and she was sure
to find plenty of models.</p>

<p>Not that the honest Colonel wished to make a
sickly humbug of her. His own views were wide
and grand, only too philoprogenitive. Still, like
most men of that class, who, upon sudden reformation,
love Truth so much that they roll upon her,
having no firm rules of his own, and being ashamed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
to profess anything, with the bad life fresh in memory,
he took the opinion of old fogeys who had
been every bit as unblest as himself, but had sown
with a drill their wild oats. The verdict of all was
one&mdash;“Miss Nowell must go to England.”</p>

<p>Finding his wound still troublesome, he resolved
to retire from service; he had not saved half a
lac of rupees, and his pension would not be a
mighty one; but, between the two, there would be
enough for an old man to live upon decently, and
go wherever he was told that his daughter ought
to go.</p>

<p>He had seen enough of life, and found that it
only meant repentance; all that remained of it
should be for the pleasure and love of his daughter.
And he knew that there was a sum in England,
which must have been long accumulating&mdash;a sum
left on trust for him and his children, under a very
old settlement. He would never touch a farthing
of it; every farthing should go to Eoa. Bless her
dear eyes; they had the true light of his own
Bright Eyes of the Morning.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="p2">Eoa was now sixteen years old, tall, and lithe,
and graceful as the creepers of tropic woodlands.
Her face was of the clearest oval, a
quick concise terse oval, such as we find in the
eggs of wild birds rather than of tame ones.
Her eyes were of bewildering brightness, always
flashing, always in motion, rarely allowing the
gazer a chance of guessing what their colour was.
Very likely they were of no positive colour, but a
pure dark lustre, such as a clear swift river has,
when overhung by palm&ndash;trees. Her complexion,
beautifully soft and even, was toned with a delicate
eastern tinge, like that fawn&ndash;coloured light which
sometimes flushes a cloudless sky before the midsummer
sunrise. And her warm oriental blood
suffused it, at the slightest emotion, as the leaping
sun pervades that sky with a flood of limpid
rubies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>She had never been flattened by education: all
her qualities and feelings, like her beauty, were in
excess. You could see it in the quick rise and fall
of her breath, in the sudden grace of her movements,
in the infinite variety of her attitudes and
aspects.</p>

<p>Whatever she thought, she said at once; yet
none ever called her a bold girl. Her modes of
thought were as widely different from those of an
English maiden, as a wild honeysuckle differs in
form, habit, and scent, from a rose. She cared
for no oneʼs opinion of her, any more than the
wind cares how a tree swings; unless indeed it
were one whom she loved, and then she would
crawl to please him. For she loved with all her
heart and soul, and hated with no less; and she
always took care in either case to apprise the object
of it. And yet, with all her depth of passion, Eoa
was pure of heart and mind,&mdash;ay, as pure as our
own Amy.</p>

<p>She soon recovered from her bruises, being perfectly
healthy, and elastic as india&ndash;rubber. Nevertheless,
she would not have been saved from that
terrible sea but for the generosity of poor Captain
Roberts, and the gallantry of Bob Garnet.</p>

<p>Now Bob was hurt rather seriously, and, being
(as we are well aware) an uncommonly shy young
fellow, he was greatly astonished, and shocked a
little, when on the Friday morning a beautiful
girl, very strangely dressed, ran to the side of his
sofa, threw her arms round him, and kissed him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
till he was out of breath, and his face was wet with
the dew of her tears.</p>

<p>“Oh, please donʼt,” said Bob; “I am sure I
donʼt deserve it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you do; and I will marry you when I am
old enough. I donʼt know what you are like, and
I donʼt care two straws, directly they told me
what you had done. Only I must have papaʼs
leave. Kiss me again, I like it. Now where is my
darling papa?”</p>

<p>“What, donʼt you know? Havenʼt they told
you? Oh, poor thing!”</p>

<p>At the tone of his voice she leaped back, like a
bird at the gun&ndash;flash, and stood with her little
hands clasped on her head, her eyes with their deep
light quivering, and the whole of her form swinging
to and fro, from the wild push of sudden
terror. Then she spoke with a hollow depth,
which frightened Bob more than the kissing.</p>

<p>“They told me that he was well, gone to his
brother somewhere, and I thought it wasnʼt like
him to leave me so, and&mdash;tell me the truth, or
Iʼll shake you to pieces.”</p>

<p>“No, donʼt,” said Bob, as she leaped at him;
“I have had shaking enough.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you poor boy, and for my sake. I am
a brute, I know. Tell me the truth, if you love
me.”</p>

<p>“Your dear father is dead. But they have
found his body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that God has been so
wicked as to kill my father?”</p>

<p>“God knows best,” said Bob; he could think
of nothing else to say.</p>

<p>“No, He doesnʼt. No, He doesnʼt. No, He
never knows anything. He couldnʼt have known
who he was, and how terribly I loved him, or
He wouldnʼt have the heart to do it. Oh, you
wicked boy; oh, you wicked boy! I will never
forgive you for saving me. Hya, hya, hya!”</p>

<p>Bob never saw such a thing before, and never
will again. And he wonʼt be much the loser;
although the sight was magnificent. The screams
and shrieks of the clearest voice that ever puzzled
echo brought up the landlord and landlady, and
our good friend Rufus Hutton, who had set forth
full speed from home on hearing about the <i>Aliwal</i>.
He caught Eoa in his arms, carried her back
to her room, and dosed her. He gave her some
Indian specific, some powder of a narcotic fungus,
which he had brought on purpose.</p>

<p>It stupefied her for nearly three days, and even
then she awoke into the dreamy state of Nirwana,
that bliss of semi&ndash;consciousness, like mild
annihilation, into which the Buddha is absorbed,
and to which all pious Buddhists look as their eternal
happiness. Then she opened her delicate
tapering arms, where you could see the grand
muscles moving, but never once protruding, and
she called for her darling father to come. Finding
that he did not come, she was satisfied with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
some trifling answer, and then wanted to have Bob
instead; but neither was Bob forthcoming.</p>

<p>On the very day when Dr. Hutton came to look
for Eoa, Mr. Garnet found himself getting better
from that wretched low nervous fever into which
his fright had thrown him. Then he asked Dr.
Hutton whether there would be any danger in
moving Robert, and, finding that there would be
none whatever, if it were carefully managed, he
ordered a carriage immediately, and with some of
his ancient spirit. The Crown, which had the
cross&ndash;bar of its N set up the wrong way (as is done,
by&ndash;the&ndash;by, on the roof of Hampton Court chapel,
and in many other places), made public claim to be
regarded as a “commercial hotel and posting&ndash;house.”
No Rushford folk having yet been
known to post anything, except a letter at rare
intervals, and a bill at rarer, this claim of the
Crown had never been challenged, and strangers
entertained a languid theoretical faith in it. But
Mr. Brown looked very blue when Bull Garnet in
reviving accents ordered “a chaise and pair at the
door in half an hourʼs time; a roomy chaise, if you
please, because my son must keep his feet up.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; yes, to be sure, sir; I quite understand,
sir. It shall be attended to, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then why donʼt you go and order it?”</p>

<p>“To be sure, sir; I forgot. I will speak to
Mrs. Brown, sir.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown, being a woman of resource, mounted
the boy on her donkey, the only quadruped she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
possessed, but a “wonner to go,” as the boy said,
“when you knows the right place to prog him in,”
and sent him post&ndash;haste to Lymington, whence the
required conveyance arrived in about an hour and
a half.</p>

<p>Rufus Hutton, having promised to be at home
that evening, left Eoa to sleep off her heavy
soporific, and followed the carriage on horseback;
neither did he leave its track where the Ringwood
Road turns off, for he had undertaken to tell Sir
Cradock how his niece was getting on. He started
nearly half an hour after the Lymington chaise,
for Polly would never demean herself by trotting
behind the “posters.” During that half&ndash;hour he
drank hot brown brandy&ndash;and&ndash;water, although he
could not bear it, to ingratiate him with Mrs.
Brown for the sake of the poor Eoa. For Mrs.
Brown had no other hot method of crowning the
flowing bowl. And now, while I think of it, let
me warn all gentle and simple people who deign on
this tale of the New Forest, never to ask for pale
brandy within the perambulations. How do you
think they make it? By mixing brown brandy
with villanous gin. Rufus was up to this, of
course; and, as he must take something for the
good of the house, and to get at the kindly kernel
of the heavy&ndash;browed hostess, he took that which he
thought would be least for his own evil. Then,
leaving Mrs. Brown (who, of course, had taken her
own glass at his sole charge and largesse, after fifty
times “Oh no, sir, never! Oh Lord, how my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Brown would be shocked!”), having imbued that
good Mrs. Brown, who really was not a bad woman&mdash;which
means that she was a good one, for women
have no medium&mdash;with a strong aromatic impression
that he was a pleasant gentleman, and no pride,
not a bit of it, in him, no more than you nor me
might,&mdash;off he trotted at a furious pace, smoking
two cheroots at once.</p>

<p>I believe that there was and is&mdash;for I am happy
to say that he still inhales the breeze of life down
his cigar, and looks browner and redder than ever&mdash;I
believe that, in spite of all his troubles in connexion
with this story, which took a good deal out
of him, there was and is no happier man in our
merry England than the worthy Rufus Hutton.
And, as all happiness is negative, and goes without
our knowing it, and only becomes a positive past
for us to look back upon, so his went before it came,
and goes or eʼer it comes. And yet he enjoys it
none the less; he multiplies it by three for the past
and by nine for the future, and he never finds it
necessary to deduct for the present moment.</p>

<p>Happy man who never thinks beyond salutary
average, who can accept, in perfect faith, the traditions
of his forbears, and yet is shrewd enough to
hope that his grandsons will discard at least a portion
of them,&mdash;who looks upon the passing life as a
thing he need not move in, a world which must
improve itself, and every day is doing it. And
all the while he sympathises with his fellow&ndash;men,
enjoys a bit of human nature, laughs at the cross&ndash;purposes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
of native truth and training, loves whatever
he finds to be true, and does his best to foster
it, is pleased with his after&ndash;dinner story, and feels
universally charitable; then smiles at his wife, and
kisses his children; and goes to bed with the firm
conviction that they are worth all the rest put
together.</p>

<p>Yet this manʼs happiness is not sound, because
it is built upon selfishness.</p>

<p>In Nowelhurst village Dr. Hutton met Mark
Stote, the gamekeeper, who begged him to stop for
a moment, just to hear a word or two. Rufus,
after hearing his news, resolved to take the upper
road to the Hall, past Mr. Garnetʼs house; it was
not so very far out of his way, and perhaps he
might be of service there, and&mdash;ah, yes, Dr. Hutton,
this last was the real motive, though you may
not have thought so&mdash;what a fine opportunity to
discover something which plagued him! Perhaps
I ought to say rather, the want of which was
plaguing him. Rufus took so kind an interest in
his neighbours’ affairs, that anything not thoroughly
luculent in their dealings, mode of life or
speech, or management of their households, was to
him the subject&ndash;matter of continual mental scratchings.
Ah, how genteel a periphrase, worthy of
Bailey Kettledrum; how happily we have shown
our horror of that English monosyllable, beginning
with the third vowel, which must be (according to
Dr. Aldrich) the correlative of scratch! Score
two, and go on after Dr. Hutton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>He overtook the Garnets twain just at their front
gate, whence the house could not be seen, on
account of a bank of evergreens. The maid came
out with her cap flying off, and all her mind perturbed.
Rufus Hutton, checking his mare, for the
road was very narrow, heard the entire dialogue.</p>

<p>“Oh, sir! oh, master! have you heard of it?
Such a thing, to be sure!”</p>

<p>“Heard of what, Sarah? Of course I have
heard of the great disaster at Rushford.”</p>

<p>“No, no. Here, sir, here! The two big trees
is down on the house. Itʼs a mussy as Nanny and
me wasnʼt killed. And poor Miss Pearl have been
in hysterics ever since, without no dinner. There,
you can hear her screeching now, worse than the
mangle, ever so much.”</p>

<p>Mr. Garnet did not say a word, but set off for the
house full speed, even forgetting that Bob wanted
help to get from the gate to the doorway.</p>

<p>Rufus Hutton jumped down from his mare, and
called to the driver to come and hold her, just for
a minute or two; no fear of <i>his</i> horses bolting.
Then, helping Bob to limp along, he followed
through the shrubbery. When they came within
full view of the house, he was quite amazed at the
mischief. The two oaks interlocked had fallen
upon it, and, crashing as they did from the height
above, the breaches they made were hideous. They
had cloven the house into three ragged pieces, from
the roof&ndash;ridge down to the first floor, where the solid
joists had stopped them. It had happened in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
afternoon of the second day of the tempest; when
the heart of the storm was broken, but tremendous
squalls came now and then from the bright north&ndash;west.
Mr. Garnetʼs own bed was occupied by the
tree which he detested. Pearl had screamed
“Judgment, judgment!” and danced among the
ruins; so the maid was telling Mr. Garnet, as he
feared to enter his own door.</p>

<p>“Judgment for what?” asked Rufus Hutton,
and Mr. Garnet seemed not to hear him.</p>

<p>“I am sure I donʼt know, sir,” answered the
maid, “for none of us done any harm, sir; unless
it was the bottle of pickled onions, when master
were away, and there was very few of them left,
sir, very few, I do declare to you, and we thought
they was on the turn, sir, and it seemed such a
pity to waste them. And please, sir, weʼve all been
working like horses, though frightened out of our
lives ‘most; and we fetched down all the things
from your room, where the cupboards was broken
open, for ‘fraid it should come on to rain, sir; and
weʼve taken all our meals standing, sir; and made
up a bed in the meat&ndash;screen, and another upon the
dresser; and Miss Pearl, what turns she have given
us&mdash;&mdash; Here she comes, I do declare.”</p>

<p>“Dr. Hutton,” said Bull Garnet, hastily, “good&ndash;bye;
I am much obliged to you. I shall see you,
I hope, next week. Good&ndash;bye, good&ndash;bye. Excuse
me.”</p>

<p>But, before he could get him out of the way&mdash;for
Rufus lingered strangely&mdash;Pearl Garnet came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
into the little hall, with her eyes distended fearfully.
“There, there it is,” she cried, “there it is,
I tell you! No wonder the tree came down upon
it. No wonder the house was crushed for it.” And
she pointed to a shattered box, tilted up endwise,
among a heap of account&ndash;books, clothes, and furniture.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, you may look at it. To be sure you
may look at it. God would not have it hidden
longer. I have done my best, God knows, and my
heart knows, and my&mdash;I mean that man there
knows. Is there anything more I can do for you,
anything more, <i>dear father</i>? You have done so
much for me, you know. And I will only ask you
one little thing&mdash;put me in his coffin.”</p>

<p>“The girl is raving,” cried Mr. Garnet. “Poor
thing, it comes from her mother.”</p>

<p>“No, it comes from her father,” said Pearl,
going boldly up to him, and fixing her large bright
eyes upon his. “Do as you like with me; I donʼt
care; but donʼt put it on any one else. Oh,
father, father, father!”</p>

<p>Moaning, she turned away from him; and then
sprang into his arms with shrieks. He lifted her
tenderly, and forgot all about his own safety. His
great tears fell on her wan, sick face; and his
heavy heart throbbed for his daughter only, as he
felt hers bounding perilously. He carried her off
to an inner room, and left them to their own
devices.</p>

<p>“I should like uncommonly,” said Rufus Hutton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
rubbing his chin, “to know what is in that box.
Indeed, I feel it my duty at once to ascertain.”</p>

<p>“No, you shanʼt,” cried Bob, limping across in
front of it; “I know no more than you do, sir.
But I wonʼt have fatherʼs things pryed into.”</p>

<p>“You are very polite,” replied the Doctor; “a
chip of the old block, I perceive. But, perhaps,
you will believe me, my boy, when I tell you that,
if ever there was a gentleman totally devoid of improper
curiosity, it is Dr. Rufus Hutton, sir.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so glad,” said Bob; “because you
wonʼt be disappointed, then.”</p>

<p>Rufus grinned, in spite of his wrath; but he
was not to be baffled so easily. He could not push
poor Bob aside, in his present disabled state, without
being guilty of cowardice. So he called in an
auxiliary.</p>

<p>“Betsy, my dear, your young mistress wished
me just to examine that box. Be kind enough to
bring it to the light here, unless it is too heavy for
your little hands.”</p>

<p>Oh, if he had only said “Miss Sarah,” what a
difference it might have made!</p>

<p>“Betsy, indeed!” cried Sarah, who had followed
her mistress, but, being locked out, had come back
to see the end of it; “my name, sir, is nothing so
low as that. My name is Sarah Mackarness, sir,
very much at your service; and my mother keeps
a potato&ndash;shop, the largest business in Lyndhurst,
sir. Betsy, indeed! and from a stranger, not to
say a strange gentleman, for fear of making a mistake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
And as for my hands”&mdash;she thought he had
been ironical, for her hands were above regulation
size&mdash;“my hands are such as pleased God to make
them, and honest hands, anyhow, and doesnʼt want
to interfere with other peopleʼs business. Oh, what
will poor Nanny say, to think of me, Sarah Mackarness,
be permiscuous called Betsy?”</p>

<p>At this moment, when Sarah Mackarness, having
recovered breath, was starting into another native
discourse on prænomina, and Rufus was calling
upon his resources for some constitutional measure,
Bull Garnet came back, treading heavily, defiant
of all that the world could do. His quick eyes,
never glimpsing that way, but taking in all the
room at once, espied the box unmeddled with, and
Bob upon guard in front of it. He was his own
man now again. What did he care for anybody,
so long as he had his children?</p>

<p>“Dr. Hutton, I thought that you were gone.”</p>

<p>“You see I am not,” said Rufus, squaring his
elbows, and looking big, for he was a plucky little
fellow, “and, whatʼs more, I donʼt mean to go till
I know what is in that box.”</p>

<p>“Box, box!” cried Bull Garnet, striking his
enormous forehead, as if to recall something;
“have we a box of yours, Dr. Hutton?”</p>

<p>“No, no; that box of <i>yours</i>. Your daughter
told us to examine it. And, from her manner, I
believe that I am bound to do so.”</p>

<p>“Bound to examine one of my boxes!” Bull
Garnet never looked once that way, and Rufus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
took note of the strange avoidance; “my boxes
are full of confidential papers; surely, sir, you
have caught my daughterʼs&mdash;I mean to say, you
are labouring under some hallucination.”</p>

<p>“There are no papers in that box. The contents
of it are metal. I have seen one article
already through the broken cover, and shall not
forget its shape. Beware; there have been strange
things done in this neighbourhood. If you refuse
to allay my suspicions, you confirm them.”</p>

<p>The only answer he received was a powerful
hand at the back of his neck, a sensation of being
lifted with no increase of facilities for placid
respiration; finally, a lateral movement of great
rapidity through the air, and a loud sound as of a
bang. Recovering reasonʼs prerogative, he found
himself in a dahlia, whose blossoms, turned into
heel&ndash;balls by the recent frost, were flapping round
his countenance, and whose stake had gone through
his waistcoat back, and grazed his coxendix, or
something; he knows best what it was, as a medical
man deeply interested.</p>

<p>He had also a very unpleasant reminiscence of
some such words as these, to which he had no
responsive power&mdash;“You wonʼt take a hint like a
gentleman; so take a hit like a blackguard.”</p>

<p>Dr. Rufus Hutton was not the man to sit down
quietly under an insult of any sort. At the moment
he felt that brute force was irresistibly in
the ascendant, and he was wonderfully calm about
it. He shook himself, and smoothed his waistcoat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
and tried the stretch of his garters; then never
once looked toward the house, never shook his fist,
nor frowned even. He walked off to his darling
Polly as if nothing at all had happened; gave the
man a shilling for holding her, after looking long for
a sixpence; then mounted, and rode towards Nowelhurst
Hall, showing no emotion whatever. Only
Polly knew that burning tears of a brave manʼs
sense of ignominy fell upon her glossy shoulder,
and were fiercely wiped way.</p>

<p>At the Hall he said nothing about it; never
even mentioned that he had called at Garnetʼs
cottage; but told Sir Cradock, like a true man, of
Eoaʼs troubles, of her poor forlorn condition, and
power of heart to feel it. He even contrived to
interest the bereaved man, now so listless, in the
young life thrown upon his care, as if by the
breath of heaven. We are never so eloquent for
another as when our own hearts are moved deeply
by the feeling of wrong to ourselves; unless, indeed,
we are very small, and that subject excludes
all others.</p>

<p>So it came to pass that the grand new carriage
was ordered to the door, and Sir Cradock would
himself have gone&mdash;only Rufus Hutton had left
him, and the eloquence was oozing. The old man,
therefore, turned back on the threshold, saying to
himself that it would be hardly decent to appear
in public yet; and Mrs. OʼGaghan was sent instead,
sitting inside, and half afraid to breathe for
fear of the crystal. As for her clothes, they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
good enough, she knew, for the Lord Mayorʼs
coach. “Five&ndash;and&ndash;sixpence a yard, maʼam, lave
alone trimming and binding.” But, knowing what
she did of herbs, she could not answer for the
peppermint.</p>

<p>Of course, they did not intend to fetch poor Eoa
home yet; but Biddy had orders to stay there
until the young lady was moveable. Biddy took
to her at once, in her heavy, long&ndash;drawn sleep, with
the soft black lashes now and then lifting from the
rich brown cheek.</p>

<p>“An’ if she isnʼt illigant, then,” said Biddy to
Mrs. Brown, “ate me wiʼout a purratie. Arl coom
ov’ the blude, missus. Sazins, then, if me and Pat
had oonly got a child this day! Belikes, maʼam,
for the matter o’ that, a drap o’ whisky disagrays
with you.”</p>

<p>Biddy, feeling strongly moved, and burning to
drink her new childʼs health, showed a bottle of
brown potheen.</p>

<p>“To tell you the truth, mem,” said Mrs. Brown,
“I know nothing about them subjects. Spirituous
liquors is a thing as has always been beyond me.”</p>

<p>“Thin Iʼll clap it away again,” said Biddy, “and
the divvil only the wiser. I never takes it alone,
marm.”</p>

<p>“It would ill become me, mem,” replied Mrs.
Brown, “to be churlish in my own house, mem. I
have heard of you very often, mem. Yes, I assure
you I have, from the people as comes to bathe here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
as a lady of great experience in diseases of the
chest. If you recommend any cordial, mem, on
the strength of your experience, for a female of
weak witality, I should take it as a dooty, mem,
strictly as a dooty to my husband and two darters.”</p>

<p>“Arrah, then, Iʼm your femmale. Me witality
goes crossways, like, till I has a drap o’ the crather.”
And so they made a night of it, and Mr. Brown
had some.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="p4">Leave we now, with story pending, Biddy and
Eoa, Pearl, and even Amy; thee, too, rare Bull,
and thee, O Rufus, overcast with anger. It is
time to track the steps of him whom Fortune, blithe
at her cruel trade, shall track as far as Gades,
Cantaber, and wild Syrtes, where the Moorish
billow is for ever heaving. Will he exclaim with
the poet, who certainly was a jolly mortal,&mdash;“I
praise her while she is my guest. If she flap her
nimble wings, I renounce her charities; and wrap
me in my manhood robe, and woo the upright
poverty, the bride without a dower.” “A very fine
sentiment, Master Horace; but were you not a
little too fond even of Sabine and Lesbian&mdash;when
the Massic juice was beyond your credit&mdash;to do
anything more than <i>feel</i> it?”</p>

<p>As Cradock Nowell trudged that night towards
the Brockenhurst Station, before he got very far
from Amy, and while her tears were still on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
cheek, he felt a little timid lick, a weak offering of
sympathy.</p>

<p>Hereby black Wena made known to him that
she was melted by his misfortunes, and saw that
the right and most feeling course, and the one
most pleasing to her dead master, was the transfer
of her allegiance, and the swearing of fealty to the
brother. To which conclusion the tender mode in
which she was being carried conduced, perhaps,
considerably; for she was wrapped in Claytonʼs
woolly jacket, enthroned on Cradockʼs broad right
arm, and with only her black nose exposed to the
moon. So she jogged along very comfortably,
until she had made up her mind, and given
Cradock the kiss of seisin.</p>

<p>“Dear little thing,” he cried, for he looked on
her now as Amyʼs keepsake, “you shall go with me
wherever I go. You are faithful enough to starve
with me; but you shall not starve until after
me.”</p>

<p>Then he put her down, for he thought that a
little run would do her good, and, in spite of all
her misery, Amy had kept her pretty plump,
plumper than she herself was; and it became no
joke to carry her, with a travelling&ndash;bag, &amp;c., after
the first half mile.</p>

<p>Then Wena capered about, and barked, and
came and licked his shoe, and offered to carry the
coat for him. As he would not let her do this,
she occupied her mind with the rabbits, which
were out upon the feed largely, and were the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
she would see for a long while, except the fat
Ostenders.</p>

<p>When he got to London, and took small lodgings
at a Mrs. Ducksacreʼs, “greengrocer and general
fruiterer, Mortimer&ndash;street, Cavendish&ndash;square,”&mdash;I
quote from the ladyʼs bags: confound it, there!
I am always saying improper things; <i>honi soit</i>&mdash;I
mean, of course, her paper bags&mdash;it was not long
before he made two important discoveries, valuable
rather than gratifying.</p>

<p>The first of these discoveries was, that our university
portals are a mere side&ndash;postern, and not the
great <i>janua mundi</i>. He found his classical scholarship,
his early fame at Oxford, his love of elegant
literature, rather a disadvantage than a recommendation
for business.</p>

<p>“Prigs, sir, prigs,” said a member of an eminent
City firm; “of course, I donʼt mean to be personal;
but I have always found you Oxford men prigs,
quite unfit for desk&ndash;work. You fancy you know
so much; you are always discovering mareʼs&ndash;nests,
and you wonʼt bear to be spoken to, even if you
stick to your work; which, I assure you, is quite
the exception. Then you hold yourself aloof, with
your stupid etiquette, from the other young men,
who are quite as good as you are. I assure you,
the place was too hot to hold us with the last
Oxford man we took in the counting&ndash;house; he
gave himself such airs, the donkey! I vowed
never to do it again: and I never will, sir. Good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
morning, sir; Gregson, show this gentleman the
way out.”</p>

<p>Gregson did so with a grin, for Cradockʼs face
proved that the principal had not been altogether
wrong.</p>

<p>Is this prejudice, or, rather, perhaps, I should
say, this aversion, disappearing now&ndash;a&ndash;days, or is it
upon the increase? At any rate, one cause of it is
being removed most rapidly; for the buckram etiquette
of Oxford will soon become a tradition. We
will only hope she may not run too far into the
free and easy.</p>

<p>Cradockʼs other discovery was that 50<i>l.</i> is no
large capital to commence in life with, especially
when the owner does not find his start prepared
for him; fails to prepare it for himself; and has
never been used to economy. He would not apply
to any of his fatherʼs friends, or of the people
whom he had known in London, to help him in
this emergency. He would rather starve than do
that; for he had dropped all name and claim of
Nowell, and cut his life in twain at manhood;
and the parts should never join again. Only one
feeling should be common to the two existences,
to the happy and the wretched life; that one feeling
was the love of Amy, and, what now seemed
part of it, his gratitude to her father.</p>

<p>John Rosedew had given him a letter to a clergyman
in London, a man of high standing and
extensive influence, whom John had known at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
college. But the youth had not undertaken to
deliver that credential, and he never did so. It
would have kept him to his identity, which (so far
as the world was concerned) he wished to change
entirely, immediately, and irrevocably. So he
called himself “Nowell” no longer&mdash;although the
name is common enough in one form or another:
the Nowells of Nowelhurst, however, are proud
of the double <i>l</i>, and think a good deal of the <i>w</i>&mdash;and
Cradock Nowell became “Charles Newman,”
without license of Her Majesty.</p>

<p>Even before his vain attempts to enter the
stronghold of commerce, and before he had
learned that Oxford men are not thought “<i>prima
virorum</i>,” he had lifted the latch of literature, but
the door would not swing back for him. The
<i>mare magnum</i>&mdash;to mix metaphors, although bars
are added to the Lucrine&mdash;the <i>mare magnum</i> of
letters was more like his native element; and, if
he once could have gotten&mdash;bare&ndash;footed as we
must be&mdash;over the jagged rocks which hedge that
sea, I believe he might have swum there.</p>

<p>In one respect he was fortunate. The publishers
upon whom he called were gentlemen, and
told him the truth.</p>

<p>“Oh, poetry!” exclaimed one and all, as their
eyes fell upon his manuscript, “we cannot take
it on our own account; and, if we published it
at your expense, we should only be robbing you.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” replied Cradock, in the first surprise;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
“is there no chance, then, of a sale
for it?”</p>

<p>“None whatever. Poetry, unless it be some
oneʼs whose name is well known, is a perfect drug
in the market. In the course of ten or a dozen
years, by advertising continually, by influence
among the reviewers, by hitting some popular
vein, or being taken up by some authority, you
might attain an audience. Are you ready to encounter
all this? Even if you are, we must decline,
we are sorry to say, to have anything to do
with it.”</p>

<p>“Verse, eh? Better have cut your throat,”
more tersely replied an elderly gentleman, well
known for his rudeness to authors. However, even
that last was a friend, when compared with some
whom it might have been his evil luck to consult.
They advertise their patent methods of putting a
work before the public, without any risk to the
author, &amp;c. &amp;c. Disinterested gentlemen! They
are to have no profit whatever, except from the
sale of the work, and they know they wonʼt sell five
copies.</p>

<p>However, there are not many of this sort in an
honourable and most important profession; and
Cradock Nowell was lucky enough not to fall in
with any of them. So he accepted the verdict so
unanimously returned, and stored away with a heavy
heart his laborious little manuscript. It was only
a translation in verse of the Halieutics, and a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
short original pieces&mdash;the former at any rate valuable,
as having been revised by John Rosedew.</p>

<p>There are courts and alleys in the neighbourhood
of Mortimer&ndash;street which, for misery and poverty,
dirt and desperation, may vie with almost any of
the more famous shames of London.</p>

<p>Cradockʼs own great trouble, the sympathy he
had met with, and the comfort he received from it,
had begun by this time to soften his heart, and
render it more sensitive to the distress of others.
At first, it had been far otherwise. The feeling of
bitter injustice, resentment at, and defiance of, a
blow which seemed to him so unmerited, and, worse
than all, his own fatherʼs base and low mistrust of
him&mdash;who could have been surprised if these things,
acting upon a sad lone heart, and a bold mind beginning
to think for itself, had made the owner an
infidel? And very likely they would have done
so, when he was removed from John Rosedewʼs
influence, but for that scene with Amy. He loved
that girl so warmly, so devotedly, so purely, that,
when he found his love returned in equal quantity
and quality, it renewed his faith in justice. He
saw that there is a measure and law, even where
all appears to be anarchy and anomaly; that the
hand of God is not stretched forth upon His
children wantonly; that we cannot gauge His
circling survey by the three&ndash;inch space between
human eyes, neither does He rest His balance on
His earthly footstool. So Cradock escaped the
deadly harm, which almost seems designed to poise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
that noblest gift of Heaven&mdash;a free and glorious
intellect&mdash;he escaped it through the mercy which
gave him true affection.</p>

<p>And now once more he looked with love upon
his fellow&ndash;men, such love as the frigid atheist
school shall never form nor educate&mdash;which truth
alone to a great heart might be conclusive against
that school&mdash;the love which few religions except
our own inculcate, and no other takes for its
essence.</p>

<p>As yet he was too young to know the blind and
inhuman selfishness, the formality and truckling,
and the other paltry dishonesties, which still exist
and try to cheat us under the name of “Society.”
The cant is going by already. Every man who
dares to think knows that its laws are obsolete,
because they have not for their basis either of these
three&mdash;truth, simplicity, charity.</p>

<p>Even that young man was astonished at the
manner in which society ignores its broader and
only true meaning&mdash;fellowship among men&mdash;and
renounces all other duties, save that of shaking
from its shoes its fellow&ndash;dust. He could not look
upon the scenes so nigh to him, and to each other,
parted often by nothing more than nine inches of
brick or two inches of deal; the wealth and the
want, the feast and the famine, the satiety and the
ravening, the euphemy and the blasphemy&mdash;though
sometimes that last got inside the door, blew its
nose, and was infidelity; the prudery and the indecency,
the whispered lie and the yelled one, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
sale of maidens by their mothers, or of women
by themselves&mdash;though here again the difference
was never very perceptible; all this impious contrast,
spread as if for Godʼs approval, for the Universal
Fatherʼs blessing, in the land most chiefly
blessed by Him: which of His sons, not cast out
for ever, could look on it without weeping?</p>

<p>Cradock did something more than weep. He
went with his little stock of money, though he
knew it could not do much; and he tried to help
in little ways, though as yet he had no experience.
He bought meat, and clothes, and took
things out of pawn, and tried to make peace where
fights were.</p>

<p>At first he was grossly insulted, as a meddlesome
swell; but, when he had done two or three good
things, and done them as a brother should, he
began to be owned among them. In one thing he
was right, although he had no experience; he
confined his exertions to a very narrow compass.
Of course he got imposed upon&mdash;of course he
helped the unworthy; but after a while he began
to know them, and even the unworthy&mdash;some two
hundred per cent.&mdash;began to have faint ideas of
trying to deserve good luck.</p>

<p>One man who attempted to pick Cradʼs pocket
was knocked down by the biggest thief there.
“I wish I had a heap of money,” said Cradock,
every day; “I must keep some for myself, I suppose.
Perhaps, after all, I was wrong, in throwing
up so hastily my chance of doing good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>Then he remembered that, but for his trouble,
he might never have thought of the good to be
done. And the good done to him was threefold
as much as he could do to others. Every day he
grew less selfish, less imperious, less exacting;
every day he saw more clearly the good which is
in the worst of us.</p>

<p>There is a flint of peculiar character&mdash;I know
not the local name of it&mdash;which is found sometimes
on the great Chissel Bank, and away towards
Lyme Regis. It is as hard, and sullen, and dull a
flint (with even the outside polish lost from the
chafing of the waves)&mdash;a stone as grey and foggy&ndash;looking;&mdash;as
ever Deucalion took the trouble to cast
away over the left into an empty world. Yet it
has, through the heart of it, traversing it from pole
to pole (for its shape is always conical) a thread, a
spindle, a siphuncle, of the richest golden hue.
None but those who are used to it can see the head
of the golden column, can even guess its existence.
The stone is not hollow; it is quite distinct from
all pudding&ndash;stones and conglomerates.</p>

<p>Many such flints poor Crad came across, and
sought in vain for the beauty of them. He never
tried to split them with a hammer, as too many do
of our Boanergæ; but he was too young to see or
feel the chord of the golden siphuncle. One, especially,
one great fellow, was harder and rougher
than any flint, like the matrix of the concentric
jasper.</p>

<p>“Confound that fellow,” said Cradock to himself;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
“I never shall get at the heart of him. If
my pluck were up a little more. Iʼd fight him;
though I know he would lick me. Heʼd be sorry
for me afterwards.”</p>

<p>Issachar Jupp could lick any two men in the
court. He was a bargee, of good intentions&mdash;at
least, when he took to the cuddy; but his horses
had pulled crosswise ever since; and the devil
knew, better than the angels, what his nature now
was.</p>

<p>“None of your d&mdash;d Scripture&ndash;reading for me!”
he cried, when Cradock came near him; though
the young man had never attempted anything of
the sort.</p>

<p>He knew that the Word of God is not bread to
a blackguardʼs empty belly. And another thing
he knew&mdash;that he was not of the age and aspect
for John Bunyanʼs business. Moreover, Jupp was
wonderfully jealous of his wife, a gentle but
grimy woman, forty&ndash;five years old, whom he larruped
every day; although he might be an infidel,
he would ensure his wifeʼs fidelity. Nevertheless,
he had his pure vein, and Cradock at last got
at it.</p>

<p>Mrs. and Miss Ducksacre were very good&ndash;hearted
women, but, like many other women of that fibre,
whose education has been neglected, of a hot and
hasty order. Not that we need suppose the
pepper to be neutralized by the refinement, only
to be absorbed more equably, and transfused more
generally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>A little thing came feeling the way into the
narrow, dingy shop, one dark November evening,
groping along by the sacks of potatoes (all of them
“seconds,” for the firm did not deal much in
“Ware Regents”), feeling its way along the sacks
which towered above its head, like bulky snow&ndash;giants
embrowned with thaw; and then by the
legs of the “tatie&ndash;bin,” with the great scales hanging
above it, and then by the heap of lighting&ndash;wood,
piled in halfpenny bundles, with the ends
against the wall; and so the little thing emerged
between two mighty hills of coleworts, and under
the frugal gas&ndash;burner, and congratulated itself,
with a hug of the heart, upon safety.</p>

<p>“Take care, my dear,” cried Mrs. Ducksacre,
looking large behind the counter, “or youʼll tumble
down the coal&ndash;trap, where the black bogeys lives.
Bless my heart, if it ainʼt little Loo! Why, Loo,
I hardly knew you. You ainʼt looking like yourself
a bit, child. And who sent you out at this time of
night? What a shame, to be sure!”</p>

<p>Loo, the pride of Issachar Jupp, was rather a
pretty little body, about three and a half years old,
“going on for four,” as she loved to say, if anybody
asked her; and her pale but clean face would have
been <i>very</i> pretty, if her mother would have let her
hair alone. But it was all combed back, and tied
tightly behind, like the tail of a horse at a fair, or
as affording a spout to pour the little girl out by.
She looked up at Mrs. Ducksacre, while her fingers
played with the coleworts, for her hands were hot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and this cooled them; and then, with the instinct
of nature, she stuck up for her father and mother.</p>

<p>“Pease, maʼam, Loo not fray much,”&mdash;though
her trembling frock belied her, all over the throat
and the heart of it&mdash;“and father don from home,
maʼam, on the Wasintote” [Basingstoke canal],
“and mother dot nobody, onʼy Loo, to do thins.
And she send this, ‘cause Looʼs poor troat be bad,
maʼam.”</p>

<p>The little child, whose throat was tied up with
worn flannel from the char&ndash;bucket, with the grey
edge still upon it, wriggled in and out of her shape
and self, in the way only children can do; and at
length drew, from some innermost shrine, a halfpenny
and a farthing.</p>

<p>“And what am I to give you for it, Loo? Oh,
you poor little thing, how very hoarse you are!”</p>

<p>Loo, with a confidence in human nature purely
non&ndash;Londinian, had placed her cash upon the altar,
upon the inside of which so many worship, while
on the outside so many are sacrificed; without
circumlocution, the counter. Her eyes were below
the rim of it, till she stood upon tiptoe with one
foot, while the other was up in the colewort roots,
and then she could see the money, and she poked
out her little lips at it, as if she would fain suck it
back again.</p>

<p>“Pease, maʼam, Looʼs troat so bad, mother are
goin to make a ‘tew, tree haʼporth of tipe and a
haʼporth of ‘egents, and a fardy of inons!”</p>

<p>“What a splendid stew, Loo!” said Mrs. Ducksacre,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
seeming to smell it; “and so you want a
haʼporth of taties, and a farthingʼs worth of onions.
And you shall have them, my dear, and as good a
three farthings’ worth as ever was put up in London.
Where are you going to put them all?”</p>

<p>Loo opened her sore throat, and pointed down
it. She had not yet lost her appetite; and that
child did love tripe so.</p>

<p>“No, no, I donʼt mean that, Loo. I know you
have a nice room inside; though some will be for
mother, wonʼt it, now? I mean, how are you
going to carry it home?”</p>

<p>“In Looʼs pinney,” replied the child, delighted
with her success; for ever so many people had
told her, that the Ducksacres now were getting so
high, they would soon leave off making farthings&ndash;worths;
and any tradesman who does that is above
the sphere of the street&ndash;child.</p>

<p>“My dear, your pinney wonʼt hold them, potatoes
are so cheap now”&mdash;she had just sworn they
were awfully dear to a person she disliked&mdash;“I am
sure you canʼt carry a haʼporth. Oh, Mr. Newman,
you are so good&ndash;natured”&mdash;Cradock was just
coming in, rather glum from another failure&mdash;“I
really donʼt believe you would think you were bemeaning
yourself by going home with this poor
little atom.”</p>

<p>“I should rather hope I would not,” replied
Cradock, looking grand.</p>

<p>“Oh, I did not know. I beg your pardon, Iʼm
sure. I would go myself, only Sally is out, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the boy gone home ever so long ago. I beg your
pardon, Iʼm sure, Mr. Newman; I thought you
were so good&ndash;natured.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Ducksacre,” said Cradock, “you utterly
misunderstand me. I replied to the form of your
sentence, perhaps, rather than to its meaning.
What I meant was, that I should rather hope I
would not think it below me to go home with this
little dear. If I could suppose it any disgrace to
me, I should deserve to be kicked by your errand&ndash;boy
all round this shop, Mrs. Ducksacre; and I
am surprised you misunderstand me so. Why, I
know this little girl well; and her name is Louisa
Jupp.”</p>

<p>“Tiss Loo,” said the little child, standing up on
tiptoe, and spreading out her arms to Cradock.
All the children loved him, as the little ones at
Nowelhurst would run after Mr. Rosedew. Children
are even better judges of character than
dogs.</p>

<p>“Why, you poor little soul,” said Crad, as he
seated her on his strong right arm with her little
cheek to his, and she drew a thousand straws of
light through her lashes from the gas&ndash;jet, which
she had never yet been so close to, “how hot and
dry your lips are! I hope you are not taking the&mdash;sickness”&mdash;he
was going to say “fever,” but
feared to frighten Loo.</p>

<p>“Mother fray,” cried the small girl, proud of
the importance accruing to her, “Loo dot wever;
Irishers dot bad wever on the foor below mother.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Loo det nice thins, and lay abed, if me dot the
wever.”</p>

<p>“Put the poor childʼs things, whatever they are,
in a basket, Mrs. Ducksacre. How odd her little
legs feel! And a shillingʼs worth of grapes, if you
please, in a bag by themselves. Hereʼs the money
for them. You know Iʼll bring back the basket.
But the bags donʼt come back, do they?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, of course not. Half&ndash;a&ndash;crown a gross
for the small ones, with the name and the cross&ndash;handle
basket, and the cabbage and carrots, sir.
Sixpence more for cornopean&ndash;pattern with a pineapple,
and grapes and oranges. But lor, sir, the
cornopean” [cornucopiæ] “would frighten half our
customers. The basket&ndash;pattern pays better for an
advertisement than to get them back again, even if
parties would bring them, which I knows well they
never would, sir.”</p>

<p>Then Cradock set forth with the child on his
arm, his coat thrown over his shoulders, and the
best shillingʼs worth of foreign grapes&mdash;Mrs. Ducksacre
never bought English ones&mdash;and the best
three farthingʼs worth of potatoes and onions that
was made that day by any tradesman in any part
of London, not excluding “them low costers,” as
the Ducksacre firm expressed it.</p>

<p>Little Loo Juppʼs sore throat proved to be, as
Cradock feared it would, the first symptom of
scarlet fever; and the young man had the pleasure&mdash;one
of the highest and purest pleasures which
any man can have&mdash;of saving a human life. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
watched that trembling flame of life, and fostered
it, and sheltered it, as if “the hopes of a nation
hung”&mdash;as the penny&ndash;a&ndash;liners love to say of some
babe not a whit more valuable&mdash;upon its feeble
flicker. He hired another room for her, where the
air was purer; he made the doctor attend to the
case, which at first that doctor cared little to do;
he brought her many a trifling comfort; in a
word, he waited upon her so that the old women
of the court called him thenceforth “Nurse Newman.”</p>

<p>“What, you here again, you white&ndash;livered young
sneak!” cried Issachar Jupp, reeling in at the
door, just as Cradock was coming out; “take that,
then&mdash;&mdash;” and he lifted a great oak bludgeon, newly
cut from the towing&ndash;path of the Basingstoke Canal.
If Cradock had not been as quick as lightning,
and caught the stick over the bargemanʼs shoulder,
there would have been weeping and wailing and a
lifelong woe for Amy.</p>

<p>“Hush,” he said; “donʼt make such a noise,
man. Your child is at the point of death, in the
room overhead.”</p>

<p>Poor Crad, naturally of a bright complexion, but
pale from long unhappiness, might now have retorted
the compliment as to the “pallor jecoris.”
The bargee turned so pale, that he looked like a
collierʼs tablecloth. Then he planted his heavy
stick on the ground; else he would have lain flat
on his threshold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>“My Loo, my Loo!” was all he could say;
“oh my Loo! <i>Itʼs a lie, sir!</i>”</p>

<p>“I wish it was,” replied Cradock; “take my
arm, Mr. Jupp. Donʼt be over&ndash;frightened. We
hope with all our hearts to save her, and to&ndash;night
we shall know. Already I think I perceive some
change in her breathing, though her tongue is like
a furnace.”</p>

<p>He spoke with a tone and in a voice which no
man ever has described, nor shall, but which every
born man feels to be genuine, long ere he can
think.</p>

<p>“[Condemn] me for a [sanguineous] fool,” cried
Jupp, with two enormous tears guttering down the
coal&ndash;dust, and his great chest heaving and wanting
to sob, only it didnʼt know the way; “[condemn]
my eyes for swearing so, and making such a
[female dog] of myself, but what the [Hades] am
I to do? Oh my Loo, my Loo! If you die, Iʼll go
to [Hades] after you.”</p>

<p>Excuse me for washing out this speech to regulation
weakness; perhaps it was entered in white
on high, as the turn of a life of blackness.</p>

<p>Cradock turned away, and trembled. Who can
see a rugged man split to the bottom of his nature,
and not himself be splintered? I donʼt believe that
any can: not even the cold iron scoundrels whom
modern plays delight in.</p>

<p>“Now come up with me, Mr. Jupp,” said Crad,
taking care not to look at him, “out at this door,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
in at the other. Poor little soul! she has been so
good. You canʼt think how good she has been.
And she has taken her medicine so nicely.”</p>

<p>“Pray God Almighty not to [condemn] me, for
not [condemning] myself enough,” said Issachar
Jupp, below his breath, as he leaned on Cradockʼs
arm.</p>

<p>It was his form of prayer; and it meant more
than most of ours do. Though I may be discarded
by turtle&ndash;dove quill&ndash;drivers for daring to record it,
will he ever be worse for uttering it? Of course,
it was very shocking; but far more so to men than
to angels.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="p2">Little Looʼs fever “took the turn” that night.
Cradock went away, of course, now her own father
was come; and the savage bargee would have gone
on his knees, and crawled in that fashion&mdash;wherein
all fashion crawls&mdash;down the rough stairs, every
one of them, if the young man would only have let
him. We are just beginning to scorn the serfdom
of one mind to another. We begin to desire that
no man should, without fair argument, accept our
dicta as equal to his own in wisdom. And I fully
believe that if fate had thrown us across Shakespeare,
Bacon, or Newton, we should now refer to
our own reason what they said, before admiring it.
For, after all, what are we? What are our most
glorious minds? Only one spark more of God.</p>

<p>And yet the servience, not of the mind, but of
the heart to a larger one, is a fealty most honourable
to the giver and the receiver. In a bold independent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
man, such as Issachar Jupp was, this
fealty was not to be won by any of that paltry
sentiment about birth, clanship, precedency, position,
appearance, &amp;c., which is our national method
of circumcising the New Testament&mdash;it was only
to be won by proof that the other heart was bigger
than his. Prove that once, and till death it was
granted.</p>

<p>Now, the small Loo Jupp being out of danger,
and her father, grinning like a gridiron with the
firelight behind it, every day at her bedside, the
force of circumstances&mdash;which, in good English,
means the want of money&mdash;sent Cradock Nowell
once more catʼs&ndash;cradling throughout London, to
answer advertisements. His heart rose within
him every day as he set out in the morning, and
in the same relative position fell, as he came home
every evening.</p>

<p>“Do, sir, do,” cried Issachar Jupp, who never
swore now, before Cradock, except under strongest
pressure; “do come aboard our barge. Iʼve
aʼmost a&ndash;got the appointment of skipper to the
<i>Industrious Maiden</i>, homeside of Nine Elms, as
tight a barge as ever was built, and the name done
in gold letters. Fact, I may say, and not tell no
secrets; I be safe to be aboord of her, if my
Loo allow me to go, and I donʼt swear hard at the
check&ndash;house. And, perhaps, I shall be able to help
it, after Loo so ill, and you such a hangel.”</p>

<p>“Well, I donʼt know,” replied Cradock, who
could not bear to simulate intense determination;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
“I should like a trip into the country, if I could
earn my wages as agent, or whatever it is. But
suppose the canal is frozen up before our voyage
begins, Jupp?”</p>

<p>“Oh, d&mdash;n that!” cried Issachar, for the idea
was too much for him, even in Cradockʼs presence;
“I never yet knew a long winter, sir, after a wonderful
stormy autumn.”</p>

<p>And in that conclusion he was right, to the best
of my experience. Perhaps because the stormy
autumn shows the set of the Gulf Stream.</p>

<p>By this time more than a month had passed
since Cradock and Wena arrived in London; half
his money was spent, and he had found no employment.
He had advertised, and answered advertisements,
till he was tired. He had worn out his
one pair of boots with walking, for he had thought
it better to walk, as it might be of service to him
to know London thoroughly; and that knowledge
can only be acquired by perpetual walking. No
man can be said to know London thoroughly, who
does not know the suburbs also&mdash;who, if suddenly
put down at the Elephant and Castle, or at Shoreditch
Church, cannot tell exactly whither each of
the six fingers points. Such knowledge very few
men possess; it requires the genius loci&mdash;to apply
the expression barbarously&mdash;as well as peculiar
calls upon it. Cradock, of course, could not
attain such knowledge in a month. Indeed, he
was obliged to ask his way to so well&ndash;known a
part as Hammersmith, when he had seen an advertisement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
for a clerk, to help in some coal&ndash;office
there.</p>

<p>With the water quelching in his boots (which
were worn away to the welting)&mdash;for the sky was
like the pulp of an orange, and the pavement
wanted draining&mdash;he turned in at a little gate near
the temporary terminus of the West London line.
In a wooden box, with a kitchen behind it, he
found Mr. Clinkers; who thought, when he saw
Cradʼs face, that he was come to give a large
order; and when he saw his boots, that he was
come to ask to be errand&ndash;boy. Clinkers was a
familiar, jocular, red&ndash;faced fellow, whom his
friends were fond of calling “not at all a bad
sort.”</p>

<p>“Take a glass, mister,” said he, when Cradock
had stated his purpose; “wonʼt do you no harm such
a day as this, and I donʼt fancy ‘twould me either.
Jenny! Jenny! Why, bless that gal; ever since
my poor wife died, sheʼs along of them small&ndash;coals
fellows. Iʼll bet a tanner she is. What do you
say to it, sir? Will you bet?”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied Cradock, smiling, “it wouldnʼt
be at all a fair bet. In the first place, I know nothing
of Miss Jennyʼs propensities; and, in the
second, I have no idea what the small&ndash;coals fellows
are.”</p>

<p>The small&ndash;coals men are the truck&ndash;drivers and
the greengrocers in the by&ndash;streets, who buy the
crushings and riddlings by the sack, at the wharf
or terminus, and sell them by the quarter hundred&ndash;weight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
weight, at a profit of two hundred per cent.
Cradock might have known this, but the Ducksacre
firm was reticent upon some little matters.</p>

<p>Mr. Clinkers could not stop to explain; only he
said to himself, “Pretty fellow to apply for a clerkship
in the coal&ndash;line, and not know that!”</p>

<p>Jenny appeared at last, looking perfectly self&ndash;possessed.</p>

<p>“Jenny, you baggage, two tumblers and silver
teaspoons in no time. And the <i>little</i> kettle; mind
now, I tell you the <i>little</i> kettle. Canʼt you understand,
gal, that I may want to shave with the
water, but ainʼt going to have the foot&ndash;tub?”</p>

<p>Jennyʼs broad face, mapped with coal&ndash;dust,
grinned from ear to ear, as she looked at her
master saucily&mdash;a proof almost infallible of a very
genial government. She heard that shaving joke
every day, and, the more she heard it, the more
she enjoyed it. So the British public, at a theatre,
or an election, appreciates a joke according to the
square of the number of the times the joke has
been poked at it. Hurrah for the slow perception,
and the blunt knife that opens the oyster!</p>

<p>“Queer gal, that,” said Clinkers, producing his
raw material; “uncommon queer gal, sir, as any
you may have met with.”</p>

<p>“No doubt of it,” replied Cradock; “and now
for the cause of my visit&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hang me, sir, you donʼt understand that gal.
I say she is the queerest gal that ever lived out of
a barge. You should see her when she gets along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
of some of them small&ndash;coals fellows. Blow me if
she canʼt twist a dozen of them round her finger,
sir.”</p>

<p>“And her master too,” thought Cradock; “unless
I am much mistaken, she will be the new Mrs.
Clinkers.”</p>

<p>Jenny heard most of her masterʼs commentary
as she went to and fro, and she kept up a constant
grin without speech, in the manner of an empty
coal&ndash;scuttle.</p>

<p>“Ah, sir, grief is a dry thing, a sad dry thing;”
and Clinkers banged down his tumbler till the
spoon reeled round the brandy; “no business, if
you please now, not a word of business till we both
be below the fiddle; and, if it isnʼt to your liking,
speak out like a man, sir.”</p>

<p>“Below the fiddle, Mr. Clinkers! What fiddle?
I donʼt at all understand you.”</p>

<p>“Very few people does, young man; very few
people indeed. Scarcely any, I may say, except
Jenny and the cookshop woman; and the latter
have got encumbrances as quite outweighs the
business. Ainʼt you ever heard of the fiddle of a
teaspoon, sir?”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well,” said Cradock, tossing off his
brandy&ndash;and&ndash;water to bring things to a point. It
was a good thing for him that he got it, poor fellow,
for he was sadly wet and weary.</p>

<p>“Lor, now, to see that!” cried Clinkers, opening
his eyes; “Iʼm blowed if you mustnʼt be a
Hoxford gent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“To be sure, so I am,” replied Cradock, laughing;
“but I should not have thought that you
would have known&mdash;I mean, I am surprised that
you, at this distance, should know anything of
Oxford men.”</p>

<p>“Tell you about that presently. Come over
again the fire, sir. Up with your heel&ndash;tap, and
have another.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you, Mr. Clinkers. You are very
kind; but I shall not take one drop more.”</p>

<p>“Then you ainʼt been there very long, thatʼs
certain. Now you have come about this place, I
know; though itʼs a queer one for a Hoxford gent.
‘Gent under a cloud,’ thinks I, the moment I claps
eyes on you. Ah, I knows the aristocraxy, sir.
Now, what might be your qualifications?”</p>

<p>“None whatever, except such knowledge as
springs from a good education.”</p>

<p>“Whew!” whistled Mr. Clinkers, and that
sound was worth fifty sentences.</p>

<p>“Then you conclude,” said Cradock, not so
greatly downcast, for he had got this speech by
heart now, “that I am not fitted for the post offered
in your advertisement?”</p>

<p>“Knows what they Hoxford gents is,” continued
Clinkers, reflectively; “come across a lot of them
once, when I was gay and rattling. They ran into
my tax&ndash;cart, coming home from Ascot, about a
mile this side of Brentford. Famous good company
over a glass, when they drops their aristocraxy;
they runs up a tick all over town, and leaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
a Skye dog to pay for it; comes home about four
in the morning, and donʼt know the latch from the
scraper. Always pays in the end, though; nearly
always pays in the end&mdash;so a Hoxford tradesman
told me&mdash;and interest ten per cent. Differs in
that from the medicals; the fast medicals never do
pay, sir.”</p>

<p>“Most unjust,” said Cradock, rising, “a most
unjust thing, Mr. Clinkers; you not only judge
the present by the past, but you reason from the
particular to the universal&mdash;the most fruitful and
womanlike of the fallacies.”</p>

<p>“It ainʼt anything about fallacy, sir, that makes
me refuse you,” cried Clinkers, who liked this outburst;
“Iʼll tell you just what it is. You Hoxford
scholars may be very honest, <i>but you ainʼt got the
grease for business</i>.”</p>

<p>Sorely down at heart and heel, Cradock plodded
away from the yard of the hospitable Clinkers,
who came to the door and looked after him, fearing
to indulge his liking for that queer young fellow.
But he had taken Cradʼs address; for who knew
but something might turn up?</p>

<p>“That man,” said Cradock to himself, “has a
kindly heart, and would have helped me if he
could. He wanted to pay my fare back to town,
but of course I would not let him. It was well
worth while to come all this distance, and get wet
through twice over, to come across a kind&ndash;hearted
man, when a fellow is down so. I began with applying
for grand places; what a fool I was! Places<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
worth 150<i>l.</i> or 200<i>l.</i> a&ndash;year. No wonder I did not
get them: and what a lot of boot I have wasted!
Now I am come down to 50<i>l.</i> per annum, and 75<i>l.</i>
would be a fortune. If I had only begun at that
mark, I might have got something by this time.
‘Vaulting ambition doth oʼerleap itself.’ And I
might have emigrated&mdash;good Heavens! I might
have emigrated upon the bounty of Uncle John,
to some land where a man is worth more than
the cattle of the field. Only Amy stopped me,
only the thought of my Amy. Darling love, the
sweetest angel&mdash;stop, I am so unlucky; if I begin
to bless her, very likely sheʼll get typhus fever.
After all, what does it matter what sort of life I
take to? Or whether, indeed, I take the trouble
to take to any at all? Only for her sake. A man
who has done what I have lives no more, but drags
his life. Now Iʼll go in for common labour, work
of the hands and muscles; many a better man has
done it; and it will be far wiser for me while my
brain is so loose and wandering. I wonder I never
thought of that. Isnʼt it raining, though! What
we used, in the happy days, to call ‘Wood Fidley
rainʼ”.</p>

<p>The future chironax trudged more cheerfully
after this decision. But he was very sorry to get
so soaked, for he had his only suit of clothes on.
He had brought but one suit of his own; and all he
had bought with the rectorʼs money was six shirts
at 3s. 6d., and four pairs of cotton hose. So he
could not afford to get wet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>There could be no doubt that he was shabbily
dressed, no rich game to an hotel&ndash;tout, no tempting
fare to a cabman; but neither could there be
any doubt that he was a pure and noble gentleman;
that was as clear as in the heyday of finest
Oxford dandyism. Only he carried his head quite
differently, and the tint of his cheeks was gone.
He used to walk with his broad and well&ndash;set head
thrown back, and slightly inclined to one side;
now he bore it flagging, drooping, as if the spring
of the neck were gone.</p>

<p>But still the brave clear eyes met frankly all who
cared to look at him; the face and gait were of a
man unhappy but not unmanly. If, at the time
Sir Cradock condemned his only son so cruelly, he
had looked at him once, and read the sorrow so
unmistakeable in his face, the old man might have
repented, and wept, and saved a world of weeping.
A tear in time saves ninety&ndash;nine; but who has the
sense to yield it?</p>

<p>Soaked and tired out at last, he reached his little
lodgings&mdash;quite large enough for him, though&mdash;and
found Black Wena warming the chair, the
only chair he had to sit on. Unluckily, he did not
do what a man who cared for himself would have
done. Having no change of raiment&mdash;in plain
English, only one pair of trousers&mdash;he should have
gone to bed at once, or at any rate have pulled his
wet clothes off. Instead of doing so, he sat and
sat, with the wet things clinging closer to him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
the shivers crawling deeper, until his last inch of
candle was gone, and the room was cold as an icehouse,
for the rain had turned to snow at nightfall,
and the fire had not been lit.</p>

<p>Wena sat waiting and nodding upwards, on the
yard and a half of brown drugget, which now was
her chiefest <i>pulvinar</i>, and once or twice she nudged
her master, and whined about supper and bedtime.
But Cradock only patted her, and improved the
turn of his sentence. He was making one last
effort to save from waste and ridicule his tastes and
his education. A craftsman, if he have self&ndash;respect,
is worthy, valuable, admirable, nearer to the perception
of simple truth than some men of high
refinement. Nevertheless, it is too certain&mdash;as I,
who know them well, and not unkindly, can testify&mdash;that
there is scarcely one in a dozen labourers,
even around the metropolis, who respects himself
and his calling. Whose fault this is, I pretend not&mdash;for
pretence it would be&mdash;to say. Probably, the
guilt is “much of a muchness,” as in all mismanaged
matters. The material was as good as
our own; how has it got so vitiated? It is as
lowering to us as it is to themselves, that the
“enlightened working&ndash;men of England” cannot go
out for their holiday, cannot come home from their
work, cannot even speak among their own children,
and in the goodwifeʼs presence, without words, not
of manly strength, but of hoggish coarseness. In
time this must be otherwise; but the evil is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
cured easily. The boy believes it manly to talk as
he hears his father talk; he rejoices in it the more,
perhaps, because the school forbids it. He does
not know what the foul words mean; and all things
strange have the grandest range. Those words tell
powerfully in a story, with smaller boys round him
upon the green, or at the street&ndash;corner. And so
he grows up engrimed with them, and his own
boys follow suit.</p>

<p>Cradock was young and chivalrous, and knew
not much of these things, which his position had
kept from him; nor in his self&ndash;abandonment cared
he much about them. Nevertheless, he shrank
unconsciously from the lowering of his existence.
And now he sat up, writing, writing, till his wet
clothes made little pools on the floor, while he
answered twenty advertisements, commercial, literary,
promiscuous. Then he looked at his little
roll of postage&ndash;stamps, and with shivering fingers
affixed them. There were only fifteen; and it was
too late to get any more that night; and he felt
that he could not afford to use them now so rashly.
So he ran out into the slushy streets, gamboged
with London snow, and posted those fifteen of his
letters which were the least ambitious. By this
time he knew that the best chance was of something
not over&ndash;gorgeous. Wena did not go with
him, but howled until he came back. Then he
gave the poor little thing, with some self&ndash;reproach
at his tardiness, all the rest of his cottage loaf, and
his haʼporth of milk, which she took with some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
protestations, looking up at him wistfully now and
then, to see whether he was eating.</p>

<p>“No, Wena, I canʼt eat to&ndash;night; bilious from
over&ndash;feeding, perhaps. But Iʼve done a good eveningʼs
work, and weʼll be very plucky for breakfast,
girl, and have sixpenceworth of cold ham. No
fear there of making a cannibal of you, you innocent
little soul.”</p>

<p>He was desperately afraid, as most young fellows
from the country are, of having unclean animals
spicily served up by the London allantopolæ.
This terror is the result for the most part of rustic
sham knowingness, and the British love of stale
jokes. However, beyond all controversy, dark are
the rites of sepulture of the measly pigs around
London.</p>

<p>He crept, at last, beneath his scanty bedding&mdash;clean,
although so patched and threadbare&mdash;and
the iron cross&ndash;straps shook and rattled with the
shudders that went through him.</p>

<p>Wena, who slept beneath the bed in a nest
which she made of the drugget&ndash;scrap, jumped upon
the blanket at midnight, to know pray what was
the matter. Then she licked his face, and tried to
warm him, in his broken slumbers. That day he
had taken a virulent cold, which struck into his
system, and harboured there for a fortnight, till it
broke out in a raging fever.</p>

<p>The next day, Cradock received a letter, of
doubtful classicality, and bearing the Hammersmith
post&ndash;mark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“<span class="smcap">Respected Sir</span>,&mdash;Was sorry after you
streaked off yesterday that had not kept you
longer. You was scarce gone out of the gate as
one might say, when in comes a gent, no end of a
nob, beats you as one might say in some respects,
and a head of hair as good. Known by the name
of Hearty,&mdash;Hearty Wibraham, Esquire, but
friends prefers callin’ him Hearty, such bein’ his
character. And hearty he were with my brandy,
I do assure you, and no mistake. This gent say as
he want to establish a hagency for the sale of first&ndash;class
Hettons to the members of the <i>bone tons</i>:
was I agreeable to supply him? So I say, ‘Certainly,
by all means, if I see my way to my money.’
And then he breaks out, in a manner as would
frighten some hands, about the artlessness of the
age, the suspiciousness of commercial gents, and
confidence between man and man. ‘Waste of
time,’ says I; ‘coals is coals now, and none of them
leaves this yard for nothing. Better keep that
sort of stuff,’ says I, ‘for the green young gent
from Hoxford as was here just now.’ ‘What,’ says
he, ‘Hoxford man after a situation?’ ‘ Yes,’
I says, ‘nice young gent, only under a cloud.’
Says he, ‘I loves a Hoxford man; hope he has got
some money.’ ‘ For what?’ I says; ‘have you got
anything good for him to invest in?’ ‘Havenʼt I?’
he says; ‘take a little more brandy, old chapʼ&mdash;my
own brandy, mind you, blow me if he ainʼt a hearty
one. Well, I canʼt tell you half he said, not being
a talkative man myself, since the time as I lost
Mrs. Clinkers. Only the upshot of it is, I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
you couldnʼt do no harm by callinʼ, if he write you
as he said he would.</p>

<p>“Yours to command, and hope you didnʼt get
wet,</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Robert Clinkers</span>, Jun., for <span class="smcap">Poker, Clinkers</span>,
and Co., Coal Merchants, West London
Terminuss, Hammersmith.</p>

<p>“N.B.&mdash;Coke supplied in your own sacks, on
the most moderate terms.”</p>

</div>

<p class="p2">By the next delivery, Cradock got another letter,
far more elegantly written, but not half so honest.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p2">“Mr. Hearty Wibraham, having heard of Mr.
Charles Newman from a mutual friend, Mr.
Clinkers, of Hammersmith, presents his compliments
to the former gentleman, and thinks it might
be worth Mr. Newmanʼs while to call upon him,
Mr. H. W., at six oʼclock this evening, supposing
the post to do its duty, which it rarely does.
Hearty Wibraham, No. 66, Aurea Themis Buildings,
Notting Hill district. N.B.&mdash;The above is <i>bonâ
fide</i>. References will be required. But perhaps
they may be dispensed with.</p>

</div>

<p class="pr4">“H. W.”</p>

<p class="p2">“Well,” said Cradock to Wena, shivering as he
said it, for the cold was striking into him, “you see
we are in request, my dear. Not that I have any
high opinion of Mr. Hearty Wibraham; as a gentleman,
I mean. But for all that he may be an
honest man. And beggars&mdash;as you know, Wena,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
dear, when you sit up so prettily&mdash;beggars must
not be choosers. Do you think you could walk so
far, Wena? If you could, it would do you good,
my beauty; and Iʼll see that you are not run
over.”</p>

<p>Wena agreed, rather rashly, to go; for the London
stones, to a country dog, are as bad as a
mussel&ndash;bank to a bather; but she thought she
might find some woodcocks&mdash;and so she did, at the
game&ndash;shops, and some curlews which they sold for
them&mdash;but her real object in going, was that she
had made some nice acquaintances in the neighbourhood,
whom she wanted to see again. She
wouldnʼt speak to any low dog, for she meant to
keep up the importance and grandeur of the Nowell
family, but there were some dogs, heigho! they
had such ways with them, and they were brushed
so nicely, what could a poor little country dog do
but fall in love with them?</p>

<p>Therefore Wena came after her master, and
made believe not to notice them, but she lingered
now and then at a scraper, and, when she snapped,
her teeth had gloves on.</p>

<p>When Cradock and his little dog, after many
a twist and turn, found Aurea Themis Buildings,
the master rang at the sprightly door, newly
grained and varnished. Being inducted by a
young woman, with a most coquettish cap on, he
told black Wena to wait outside, and she lay down
upon the door&ndash;step.</p>

<p>Then he was shown into the “first&ndash;floor drawing&ndash;room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>,”
according to arrangement, and requested
to “take a seat, sir.” The smart maid, who carried
a candle, lit the gas in a twinkling, but
Cradock wondered why the coal&ndash;merchant had no
coals in his fireplace.</p>

<p>Just when he had concluded, after a fit of
shivering, that this defect was due perhaps to that
extreme familiarity which breeds in a grocer contempt
for figs, Mr. Wibraham came in, quite by
accident, and was evidently amazed to see him.</p>

<p>“What! Ah, no, my good sir, not Mr. Charles
Newman, a member of the University of Oxford!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I am that individual,” replied Cradock,
very uncomfortable at the prominent use of
his “alias.”</p>

<p>“Then, allow me, sir, to shake hands with you.
I am strongly prepossessed in your favour, young
gentleman, from the description I received of
you from our mutual friend, Mr. Clinkers. Ah,
I like that Clinkers. No nonsense about Clinkers,
sir.”</p>

<p>“So I believe,” said Cradock; “but, as I have
only seen him once, it would perhaps be premature
of me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not a bit, my dear sir, not a bit. That is
one of the mistakes we make. I always rely
upon first impressions, and they never deceive
me. Now I see exactly what you are, an upright
honourable man, full of conscientiousness,
but <i>not overburdened here</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>He gave a jocular tap to his forehead, which
was about half the width of Cradockʼs.</p>

<p>“Well,” thought Cradock, “you are straightforward,
even to the verge of rudeness. But no
doubt you mean well, and perhaps you are nearer
the truth than the people who have told me otherwise.
Anyhow, it does not matter much.” But,
in spite of this conclusion, he bowed in his stately
manner, and said:</p>

<p>“If that be the case, sir, I fear it will hardly
suit your purpose to take me into your employment.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I have hurt your feelings, I see. I am so
blunt and hasty. Hearty Wibraham is my name;
and hearty enough I am, God knows; and perhaps
a little too hearty. ‘Hasty Wibraham, you ought
to be called, by Jove, you ought,’ said one of my
friends last night, and by Gad I think he was
right, sir.”</p>

<p>“I am sure I donʼt know,” said Cradock;
“how can I pretend to say, without myself being
hasty?”</p>

<p>“I suppose, Mr. Newman, you can command a
little capital? It is not at all essential, you know,
in a <i>bonâ fide</i> case like yours.”</p>

<p>“Thatʼs a good job,” said Cradock; “for my
capital, like the new one of Canada, is below contempt.”</p>

<p>“To a man imbued, Mr. Newman, with the
genuine spirit of commerce, no sum, however
small, but may be the key of fortune<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“My key of fortune, then, is about twenty
pounds ten shillings.”</p>

<p>“A very, very small sum, my dear sir; but I
dare say some of your friends would assist you to
make it, say fifty guineas. You Oxford men are
so generous; always ready to help each other.
That is why I canʼt help liking you so. Thoroughly
fine fellows,” he added, in a loud aside,
“thoroughly noble fellows, when a messmate is in
trouble. Canʼt apply to his family, I see; but it
would be mean in him not to let his friends help
him. I do believe the highest privilege of human
life is to assist a friend in difficulties.”</p>

<p>Cradock, of course, could not reply to all this,
because he was not meant to hear it; but he gazed
with some admiration at the utterer of such exalted
sentiments. Mr. Hearty Wibraham, now about
forty&ndash;five years old, was rather tall and portly, with
an aquiline face, a dark complexion, and a quick,
decisive manner. His clothes were well made, and
of good quality, unpretentious, neat, substantial.
His only piece of adornment was a magnificent
gold watch&ndash;chain, which rather shunned than
courted observation.</p>

<p>“No,” said Cradock, at last, “I have not a
single friend in the world to whom I would think
of applying for the loan of a sixpence.”</p>

<p>“Well, we <i>are</i> independent,” Mr. Wibraham
still held discourse with himself; “but Hearty
Wibraham likes and respects him the more for that.
Heʼll get over his troubles, whatever they are. My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
good sir,” he continued, aloud, “I will not utter
any opinion, lest you should think me inclined to
flatter&mdash;the last thing in the world I ever would
do. Nevertheless, in all manly candour, I am
bound to tell you that my prepossession in your
favour induces me to make you a most advantageous
offer.”</p>

<p>“I am much obliged to you. Pray, what
is it?”</p>

<p>“A clerkship in my counting&ndash;house, which I
am just about to open, having formed a very snug
little connexion to begin with.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Cradock, for, green as he was, he
would rather have had to do with a business already
established.</p>

<p>“I see you are surprised. No wonder, sir; no
wonder! But you must know that I shall have
at least my <i>quid pro quo</i>. My connexion is of a
very peculiar character. In fact, it lies entirely
in the very highest circles. To meet such customers
as mine, not only a man of gentlemanly
manners is required, but a man of birth and education.
How could I offer such a man less than
150<i>l.</i> per annum?”</p>

<p>“Your terms are very liberal, very liberal, I am
sure,” replied Cradock, reddening warmly at the
appraisement of his qualities. “I should not be
comfortable without telling you frankly that I am
worth about half that yearly sum; until, I mean,
until I get a little up to business. I shall be quite
content to begin upon 100<i>l.</i> a year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>“No! will you, though?” exclaimed Hearty
Wibraham, flushed with a good heartʼs enthusiasm.
“You are the finest young fellow I have seen since
I was your age myself. Suppose, now, we split
the difference. Say 125<i>l.</i>; and I shall work you
pretty hard, I can tell you. For we do not confine
our attention exclusively to the members of the
Ministry, and the House of Lords; we also deal
with the City magnates, and take a contract for
Somerset House. And remember one thing; you
will be in exclusive charge whenever I am away
negotiating. A man deserves to be paid, you know,
for high responsibility.”</p>

<p>“And where will the”&mdash;he hardly knew what
to call it&mdash;“the office, the counting&ndash;house, the headquarters
be?”</p>

<p>“Not in any common thoroughfare,” replied
Mr. Wibraham, proudly; “that would never do
for a business of such a character. What do you
think, sir, of Howard Crescent, Park Lane? Not
so bad, sir, is it, for the sale of the grimy?”</p>

<p>“I really do not know,” said Cradock; “but
it sounds very well. When do we open the
books?”</p>

<p>“Monday morning, sir, at ten oʼclock precisely.
Let me see: to&ndash;day is Friday. Perhaps it would
be an accommodation to you, to have your salary
paid weekly, until you draw by the quarter. Now,
remember, I rely upon you to promote my interest
in every way consistent with honour.”</p>

<p>“That you may do, most fully. I shall never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
forget your kind confidence, and your liberality.”</p>

<p>“You will have two young gentlemen, if not
three, wholly under your orders. Also a middle&ndash;aged
gentleman, a sort of sleeping partner, will
kindly attend <i>pro tem.</i>, and show you the work
expected of you. I myself shall be engaged,
perhaps, during the forenoon, in promoting the
interests of the business in a most important
quarter. Now, be true to me, Newman&mdash;I take
liberties, you see&mdash;keep your subordinates in their
place, and make them stick to work, sir. And
remember that one ounce of example is worth a
pound of precept. If you act truly and honestly
by me, as I know you will, you may look forward
to a partnership at no distant date. But donʼt be
over&ndash;sanguine, my dear boy; there is hard work
before you.”</p>

<p>“And you will not find me shrink from it,” said
Cradock, throwing his shoulders back; “but we
have not settled yet as to the amount of the premium,
or deposit, whichever it may be.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. To be sure. I quite forgot that
incident. Thirty guineas, I think you said, was all
that would be convenient to you.”</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Wibraham; I said twenty pounds ten
shillings.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, my mistake. I knew that there was
an odd ten shillings. Say twenty&ndash;five guineas. A
mere matter of form, you know; but one which
we dare not neglect. It is not a premium; simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
a deposit; to be returned at the expiration of the
first twelve months. Will you send it to me by
cheque? That, perhaps, would be the more convenient
form. It will save you from coming again.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to say I cannot; for now I have no
banker. Neither can I by any means make it
twenty&ndash;five guineas. I have stated to you the
utmost figure of my present census.”</p>

<p>“Ah, quite immaterial. I am only sorry for
your sake. The sum will be invested. I shall
hold it as your trustee. But, for the sake of the
books, merely to look well on the books, we must
say twenty guineas. How could I invest twenty
pounds ten shillings?”</p>

<p>This appeared reasonable to Cradock, who knew
nothing about investment; and, after reflecting a
minute or two, he replied as follows:</p>

<p>“I believe, Mr. Wibraham, that I might manage
to make it twenty guineas. You said, I think, that
my salary would be payable weekly.”</p>

<p>“To be sure, my dear boy, to be sure. At any
rate until further arrangements.”</p>

<p>“Then I will undertake to pay you the twenty
guineas. Next Monday, I suppose, will do for it?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, Monday will do. But stop, I shall not
be there on that morning; and, for formʼs sake, it
must be paid first. Let us say Saturday evening.
I shall be ready with a stamped receipt. Will
you meet me here at six oʼclock, as you did this
evening?”</p>

<p>Cradock agreed to this, and Mr. Hearty Wibraham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
shook hands with him most cordially, begging
that mutual trust and amity might in no way be
lessened by his own unfortunate obligation to observe
certain rules and precedents.</p>

<p>In the highest spirits possible under such troubles
as his were, Crad strode away from Aurea
Themis Buildings, and whistled to black Wena,
whom two of the most accomplished dog&ndash;stealers
in London had been doing their best to inveigle.
Failing of skill&mdash;for Wena was a deal too knowing&mdash;they
at last attempted violence, putting away
their chopped liver and hoof&ndash;meat, and other baits
still more savoury, upon which I dare not enlarge.
But, just as Black George, having lifted her boldly
by the nape of the neck, was popping her into the
sack tail foremost, though her short tail was under
her stomach, what did she do but twist round upon
him, in a way quite unknown to the faculty, and
make her upper and lower canines meet through
the palm of his hand? It wonʼt do to chronicle
what he said&mdash;I am too much given to strictest
accuracy; enough that he let her drop, in the
manner of a red&ndash;hot potato; and Blue Bill, who
made a grab at her, only got a scar on the wrist.
Then she retreated to her step, and fired a royal
salute of howls, never ending, ever beginning, until
her master came out.</p>

<p>“Wena, dear,” he said, for he always looked on
the little thing as an inferior piece of Amy, “you
are very tired, my darling; the pavement has been
too much for you. Sit upon my arm, pretty. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
are both going to make our fortunes. And then
you ‘shall walk in silk attire, and siller hae to
spare.’”</p>

<p>Wena nuzzled her nose into its usual place in
Cradockʼs identicity, and growled if any other dog
took the liberty of looking at him. And so they
got home, singing snug little songs to each other
upon the way; and they both made noble suppers
on the strength of their rising fortunes.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="p2">The following day was Saturday, and the young
fellow spent great part of it in learning the rules,
the tables, and statistics of the coal trade, so far as
they could be ascertained from a sixpenny work
which he bought. Not satisfied with this, he went
to the Geological Museum, in Jermyn&ndash;street, and
pored over the specimens, and laid in a stock of
carbonic knowledge that would have astonished
Clinkers and Jenny. When the building was
closed at four oʼclock he hurried back to Mortimer&ndash;street,
paid Mrs. Ducksacre for his weekʼs lodgings,
and ran off to a pawnbrokerʼs to raise a little
money. Without doing this, he would not be able
to deposit the twenty guineas. Mr. Gillʼs shopman
knew Cradock well, from his having been there
frequently to redeem some trifling articles for the
poor people of the court, and felt some good&ndash;will
towards him for his kindness to the little customers.
It increased the activity of his trade, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
most of the pledges were repledged or ever the
week was out. And of course he got the money
for issuing another duplicate.</p>

<p>“Hope thereʼs nothing amiss, Mr. Newman,”
said the pawnbrokerʼs assistant; “sorry to see you
come here, sir, on your own account.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you ought to congratulate me,” returned
Cradock, with a knowing smile: “I am going to
pay a premium, and enter into a good position
upon advantageous terms; very advantageous, I
may say, seeing how little I know of the coal
trade.”</p>

<p>“Take care, sir, take care, I beg of you. People
run down our line of business, and call it coining
tears, &amp;c.; but you may take my word for it, there
is a deal more roguery in the coal trade, or rather
in the pretence of it, than ever there is in the
broking way.”</p>

<p>“There can be none in the present case, for the
simple reason that I am not in any way committed
to a partnership, neither am I to be at all dependent
upon the profits.” And Cradock looked
thankful for advice, but a deal too wise to want it.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I hope it may be all right; for I am
sure you deserve it. But there is a man, not far
from here, I think you took some things out for
him, by the name of Zakey Jupp; a shrewdish
sort of fellow, though a deal too fond of fighting.
Heʼll be up to some of the coal tricks, I expect,
heʼs about in the yards so much; and the whippers
and heavers are good uns to talk. Donʼt you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
think it beneath you, sir, to consult with Zakey
Jupp, if you have the pleasure of his acquaintance.”</p>

<p>“I am proud to say that I have at last,” replied
Cradock, smiling grimly; “but he went on board
the <i>Industrious Maiden</i>, at Nine Elms, yesterday
morning, and may not be back for a month. He
wanted me to go with him; but I did not see how
to be useful, and had not given my landlady
notice. Now, if you please, I have not a moment
to spare.”</p>

<p>The shopman saw that he could not, without
being really impertinent, press his advice any
further; and, although Cradock was so communicative,
as young men are apt to be, especially
about their successes, he never afforded much
temptation to any one for impertinence.</p>

<p>“And how much upon them little articles?”
was the next question put to Cradock; and he did
not ask any very high figure, for fear of not
getting them out again.</p>

<p>As he set off full speed for Aurea Themis
Buildings, without inviting Wena, it struck him
that it would be but common prudence just to
look at the place of business; so he dashed aside
out of Oxford&ndash;street, at the rate of ten miles an
hour&mdash;for he was very light of foot&mdash;and made
his way to Howard&ndash;crescent, whose position he
had learned from the map. Sure enough there it
was, when he got to the number indicated. And
what a noble plate! So large, indeed, that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
absolutely necessary to have it in two parts. What
refulgent brass! What fine engraving, especially
on the lower part! You might call it chalco&ndash;illumination,
chromography, chromometallurgy; I
do not know any word half grand enough to
describe it. And the legend itself so simple, how
could they have made so much of it? The upper
plate, though beautifully bright, was comparatively
plain, and only carried the words, “Wibraham,
Fookes, and Co.;” the lower and far more elaborate
part enabled the public to congratulate itself
upon having the above as “Coal Merchants and
Colliery Agents to Her Most Gracious Majesty
and the Duchy of Lancaster. Hours of Business,
from Ten till Four.”</p>

<p>Cradock just took time to read this, by the light
of the gas&ndash;lamp close to it; then glanced at the
house (which looked clean and smart, though
smaller than what he expected), and, feeling
ashamed of his mean suspiciousness, darted away
towards Notting Hill. When he arrived at Aurea
Themis Buildings, he was kept waiting at the door
so long that it made him quite uneasy, lest Hearty
Wibraham should have forgotten all about his
little deposit. At last the smart girl opened the
door, and a short young man, whose dress more
than whispered that he was not given to compromise
his æsthetic views, came out with a
bounce, and clapped a shilling in the hand of
the smiling damsel. “There, Polly, get a peach&ndash;coloured
cap&ndash;ribbon, and wear it in a true knot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
for my sake. I fancy Iʼve done your governor.
Heʼs a trifle green; isnʼt he?” But, in spite of
his conversational powers, the handmaid dismissed
him summarily, when she saw Cradock waiting
there.</p>

<p>The gas in the drawing&ndash;room was lit this time,
and a good fire burning; and Mr. Wibraham, in
spirits absolutely jocular, sprang forward to meet
Cradock, and cried, “Hail, oh future partner!”
Then he offered him a glass of “rare old Madeira;”
and, producing a blank receipt form,
exclaimed, “Whatever you do, my young friend,
never let it be known in the counting&ndash;house that I
accepted you with so ridiculous a deposit as the
sum of thirty guineas.”</p>

<p>“Twenty, sir, twenty was what you agreed to
accept.” Poor Cradock trembled from head to
foot, lest even now, at the last moment, he should
be rejected. But, to his delight, his new principal
replied,</p>

<p>“Then, sir, twenty be it: if in a weak moment
I agreed. Hearty Wibraham would rather throw
up all his connexion than allow any man to say of
him, sir, that he had departed from his word.”
His voice trembled slightly, and there was a
twinkle as of tears in his eyes. Crad began to
apologize, though he could not quite see what harm
he had done.</p>

<p>“Dash it, my boy, not another word. We understand
each other. There is your receipt.”</p>

<p>In his confidence, Hearty Wibraham passed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
receipt form, now filled up, to the aspiring coal&ndash;merchant,
without having seen so much as the
colour of his money. Then Cradock pulled out
Amyʼs purse, in which he had put the cash, for
good luck, and paid his footing bravely.</p>

<p>“Sir, I will not thank you,” said Mr. Wibraham,
as he took the money, “because the act would not
be genuine. And I am proudly able to declare
that I have never yet done anything, even for the
sake of the common courtesies of life, which has
not been thoroughly genuine. My boy, this paltry
twenty guineas is the opening of your mercantile
life. May that life be prosperous; as I am sure
you deserve.”</p>

<p>Cradock took another glass of Madeira, as
genuine as its owner, and, after a hearty farewell,
felt so rapidly on the rise, so touched, for the first
time of many weeks, by the dexter wand of fortune,
that he bought a quarter of an ounce of
birdʼs&ndash;eye with an infusion of “Latakia” (grown
in the footpath field at Mitcham), and actually
warmed his dear brotherʼs pipe, which had not
once been incremated ever since the sacred fire of
the Prytaneum had languished.</p>

<p>Wena was overjoyed to see him, and she loved
the smell of tobacco, and had often come sniffing
about on the hearth&ndash;rug (or the bit of baize that
did for it) to know whether it was true that a big
man&mdash;a mastiff of a man, they told her&mdash;had succeeded
in abolishing it; now, seeing the blue curls
quivering nicely, she jumped upon his lap; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
although she was rather heavy, he thought it would
be practice towards the nursing of Amy, and possibly
Amyʼs children. Then, when he thought of
that, he grew more happy than fifty emperors.</p>

<p>Fortune may jump on a young fellowʼs heart,
with both heels set together; but, the moment she
takes one off, up it comes, like a bladder too big to
go into the football.</p>

<p>On Monday morning at ten oʼclock, our Crad, in
a state of large excitement, appeared before the gorgeous
plate, and rang the bell thereover. It was
answered by an office&ndash;boy, with a grin so intensely
humorous that it was worth all the guineas that
could have been thrust into the great mouth he
exhibited.</p>

<p>“Mr. Newman?” asked the boy, with a patronizing
air, which a little mind would have found
offensive.</p>

<p>“To be sure,” replied Cradock; “I suppose I
am expected.”</p>

<p>“That you are,” said the cheeky boy, grinning
harder than ever; “the other three gents is waiting,
sir. Get you a penny paper for three half&ndash;pence.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” answered Cradock, hoping to
depress that boy, “I am not come here, young
man, I trust, to waste time in reading the papers.”</p>

<p>“Oh no! oh lor no,” cried the boy as he led the
way in; “tip&ndash;top business this is, and all of us
wears out our marrow&ndash;bones. His Ro&ndash;oyal Highness
will be here bumbye. ‘Spect theyʼll appoint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
you to receive him, ‘cos you would look such a
swell with our governorʼs best boots on. Donʼt you
refoose now, mind me, donʼt refoose, mate, if you
loves me.”</p>

<p>“You want a little whipcord,” said Cradock;
“and you shall have it too, my boy, if you come
much into my neighbourhood.”</p>

<p>“There now; there now!” sighed the boy&mdash;who
would have been worth something on the stage&mdash;“I
have never been appreciated, and suppose I
never shall. Whatʼs the odds to a jinker? Cockalocks,
there go in, and let me mind your beaver.”</p>

<p>Cradock was shown into a room furnished as
philosophically as the wash&ndash;house of Cincinnatus;
still, it looked like business. There was no temptation
to sit down, even though one had rowing&ndash;trousers
on. There were four tall desks of deal
uncovered; each had four legs, and resembled
a naked Punch&ndash;and&ndash;Judy box. Hales, the Norfolk
giant, could not have written at either of them,
while sitting on any of the stools there.</p>

<p>Three of these desks were appropriated by three
very nice young gentlemen, all burning to begin
their labours. Two of the men were unknown to
Cradock; but the third, the very short one, who had
taken a stool to stand upon, and was mending a
pen most earnestly&mdash;him Cradock recognised at
once as the disburser of the shilling, the sanguine
youth, of broad views in apparel, who had cheated
Mr. Wibraham so.</p>

<p>“Mr. Fookes, I presume,” he exclaimed, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
leap from the stool, and a little run towards Cradock;
“you see we are all ready, sir, to receive
the junior partner. Hardly know what to be
up to.”</p>

<p>“I am sure I cannot tell you,” answered Crad,
with a smile; “I do not belong to the firm as yet,
although I am promised a partnership at a date not
very distant.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” said the little man, staring; “indeed,
I came up from Cambridge principally upon
the strength of it.”</p>

<p>“The deevil you did!” cried a tall, strapping
fellow, crossing suddenly from his desk; “if yeʼll
hearken me, my time comes first. The agrahment
was signed for Candlemas, when the gloot of business
allows it. And a Durham man knows what
coals are.”</p>

<p>“Agrayment, thin, is it?” exclaimed the fourth,
a flourishing, red&ndash;haired Irishman; “do you think
Iʼd a left me Oonivarsity, Thrinity College, Dooblin,
wiʼout having it down all black and white?
By the same token, itʼs meself as is foremost.
Christmas is the time, me boys; and the farst
dividend on St. Pathrickʼs Day, wakely sthipend in
the intherim. Divil take me sowl, but none o’ ye
shall git before Manus OʼToole.”</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” said Cradock, “donʼt let us be in
a hurry. No doubt Mr. Fookes will be here presently,
and then we can settle precedence. I see
there is work set out for us; and I suppose we are
not all strangers here.”</p>

<p>“Canʼt answer for the other gentlemen,” returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the little Cambridge man, “but I was
never here before, except to see the place on
Saturday.”</p>

<p>“And thatʼs joost my own predeecament,” cried
the tall man from Hatfield Hall.</p>

<p>“Chop me up smarl,” said the Irishman, when
they turned to him as their senior, “but the gintleman
has the advantage o’ me. I niver was here
at all, at all; and I hope I niver shall be.”</p>

<p>The four young men gathered round a desk,
and gazed sadly at one another. At this moment
the office&ndash;boy, seeing the distance safe, for he had
been watching through the keyhole, pushed his
head in at the door, and shouted, “Hi! there,
young coal&ndash;merchants, donʼt yer sell too much now!
Telegram from the Exchange, gents; grimy is on
the rise. But excoose me half an hour, gents;
Her Majesty have commanded my presence, to
put the ro&ndash;oyal harms on me. Ho&ndash;hoop! Iʼm
after you, Molly. Donʼt be afraid of my splashing
your legs, dear.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Cradock, as the rising young coal&ndash;merchants
seemed to look to him for counsel, and
stood in silent bewilderment&mdash;“it appears to me
that there is something wrong. Let us hope that
it is a mistake only; at any rate, let us stop, and
see the matter out. I trust that none of you gentlemen
have paid a premium, as I have.”</p>

<p>“I am sure I donʼt know,” said the Cantab,
“what the others have done; but I was allowed to
enter the firm for the sum of eighty guineas, a
great deal too little, considering all the advantages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
offered&mdash;the proper sum being a hundred; but an
abatement was made in my favour.”</p>

<p>“Ahty guineas!” cried the Durham man;
“why I was admeeted for saxty, because I had no
more.”</p>

<p>“Itʼs me blessed self, then, as bates you all,”
shouted the son of Dublin; “shure and Iʼve made
a clear sixty by it, for I hadnʼt no more than
forty.”</p>

<p>“And I,” replied Cradock, with a melancholy
air, “was received for the trifling sum of twenty,
on account of my being an Oxford man.”</p>

<p>“Why, gentlemen,” said the little Cantab, “let
us shake hands all round. We represent the four
chief universities, only Scotland being omitted.”</p>

<p>“Catch a Scotchman with salt, me frinds!”
cried the red Hibernian, as they went through the
ceremony. “By Jasers, but that infarnal old
Jew would have had to pay the porridge&ndash;man, for
the pleasure of his company.”</p>

<p>“Now let us fall to our work, gentlemen” (Crad
tried to look hopeful as he said it); “the
books before us may throw some light upon this
strange, and, as it seems, very roguish matter. I
was told to act for our principal, during the absence
of the sleeping partner; to keep you all in your
places, and make you stick to your work; and
especially to remember that one ounce of practice
is worth a pound of precept.”</p>

<p>“I should be most happy, sir, to obey
orders,” said the little Cambridge man, bowing;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
“only I hold the identical commission, ounce of
practice and all, for your benefit, my good sir, and
that of all the other juniors.”</p>

<p>“Now that shows a want of vareaty,” cried the
tall Dunelmian, “for the sole charge of all of ye
is commeeted to <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>“Itʼs me blessed self that got it last, and that
manes to kape it. What time wur you there, gintlemen,
at Ory Thamis Buildings?”</p>

<p>It was settled that the Irishman had received
his commission last, for, some whisky having been
produced, he and Hearty Wibraham had kept it
up until twelve oʼclock on the Saturday night.
So, to his intense delight, he was now appointed
captain.</p>

<p>“An’ if I donʼt drag him from his hole, to pay
him the sixty guineas I owe him, out of your
money, gintlemen, say my name isnʼt Manus
OʼToole. Now the fust arder I give, is to have in
the bhoy, and wallop him.”</p>

<p>Easier said than done, Mr. Toole. There was
no boy to be found anywhere; and the only result
of a strong demonstration in the passage was a curt
note from the landlord.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;I understood as I had lett my
rooms to a respectable party, rent payable weakly,
and weak is up this day. Will take it a favuor to
reseeve two pound ten per bearer.</p>

<p class="pr4">“<span class="smcap">John Codger.</span>”</p>

<p class="p1">The four university men looked wondrously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
blank at this&mdash;“gelidusque per ima cucurrit ossa
tremor.”</p>

<p>“Well, I <i>am</i> blowed!” cried the little Cantab,
getting smaller, and with the sky&ndash;blue stripes on
his trousers quivering.</p>

<p>“Thereʼs a cousin of mine, a soleecitor,” said the
young north countryman, “would take up this case
for us, if we made a joint deposeet.”</p>

<p>“Have down the landlord and fight him,” proposed
the Emerald Islander.</p>

<p>“I donʼt care a fig for the landlord,” said Cradock,
who now recalled some shavings of law from
the Quarter Sessions spokeshave; “he can do
nothing at all to us, until twelve oʼclock, and then
he can send us about our business, and no more
harm done. We were not parties to the original
contract, and have nothing to do with the rent.
Now, gentlemen, there is only one thing I would
ask you, in return for my lucid legal opinion.”</p>

<p>“What is that?” cried all the rest; “whatever
it is, you shall have it.”</p>

<p>“That you make over to me, <i>vivâ voce</i>, your
three&ndash;fourths of the brass&ndash;plate. I have taken a
strange fancy to it; the engraving is so fine.”</p>

<p>“You are perfectly welcome to it,” exclaimed the
other three; “but wonʼt it belong to the landlord?”</p>

<p>“Not if it is merely screwed on, as probably is
the case. And I have a screw&ndash;driver in my knife,
which very few screws can resist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Then go and take it, by all means, before
twelve oʼclock, for afterwards we shall only be
trespassers.”</p>

<p>Crad put his hat on and went out, but returned
with the wonderful screw&ndash;driver snapped up into
his knife&ndash;handle, and the first flush of real British
anger yet seen upon his countenance. What wonderful
beings we are! He had lost nearly all his
substance, and he was vexed most about the brass&ndash;plate.</p>

<p>“Done at every point,” he said; “that glorious
under&ndash;plate is gone, and only the narrow bar left
with the name of the thief upon it, which of course
would not suit him again.”</p>

<p>“Oysters all round!” cried the Cambridge man,
“as the landlord cannot distrain us. An oyster is
a legal esculent; I see they teach law at Oxford;
let us at least die jolly. And I claim the privilege
of standing oysters, because I have paid the highest
premium, and am the most promising partner&mdash;at
any rate, the softest fellow. Gentlemen, if you
refuse me, I claim our captainʼs decision. Captain
OʼToole, how is it?”</p>

<p>“Arrah, thin, and I order eysters at this gintlemanʼs
expinse, London stout for the waker stomiks,
and a drop o’ poteen for digestion, to them as are
wakest of all.”</p>

<p>“Done,” said the little Cantab, “if only to rile
the landlord, and he may distrain the shells. Call
four university men, by implication, unrespectable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
parties! We must have our action against him.
Gentlemen. I am off for the grub, and see that I
get in again.”</p>

<p>“Faix, then, my honey,” cried the Irishman,
forgetting all university language, “and, if ye
donʼt, ‘twill be a quare job for the bones on the
knuckles of Manus OʼToole.”</p>

<p>While all four were enjoying their oysters&mdash;for
Cradock, being a good&ndash;natured fellow, did not
withhold his assistance&mdash;a sharp rap&ndash;rap announced
the postman, and Mr. OʼToole returned from the
door with a large square letter, sealed with the
coat of arms of the company. “Ship&ndash;letther, and
eightpence to pay, begorra. Gintlemen, will we
take it?”</p>

<p>“How is it addressed?” asked two or three.</p>

<p>“Most gintaal. ‘To the sanior clerk or junior
partner of the firm of Wibraham, Fookes, and
Co., Coal Merchants,’ and thatʼs meself, if itʼs
nobody.”</p>

<p>“Then itʼs you to pey the eightpence,” cried the
Durham man.</p>

<p>“Do yer think, then, itʼs me who canʼt do it?”
answered Mr. OʼToole, angrily. And then he
broke open the letter and read:</p>

<p class="p1">“P. &amp; O. steamer <i>Will o’ the Wisp</i>, off the Start Point.&mdash;<i>Sunday.</i></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“<span class="smcap">Respected and beloved Partners</span>,&mdash;His

to light with gas the interior of the Pyramids,
also to provide hot&ndash;water bottles for the comfort
of his household&ndash;brigade, principally female, and
to erect extensive gas&ndash;cooking premises, where hot
crocodile may always be had, has entrusted me
with the whole arrangements, and the entire supply
of coal, with no restriction except that the Nile
shall not be set on fire.</p>

<p>“Interested as you are in the success of our
noble firm, you will thank, instead of blaming me,
for an apparently unceremonious departure. By
an extraordinary coincidence, Mr. Fookes has also
been summoned peremptorily to Constantinople,
to contract with the Sultan for warming the sacks
of the ladies who are, from time to time, deposited
in the Bosporus.</p>

<p>“Therefore, gentlemen, the entire interest of the
London branch is left in your experienced hands.
Be steady, I entreat you; be diligent, be methodical.
Above all things, remember that rigid probity,
and the strictest punctuality in meeting payments,
are the <i>very soul of business</i>, and that an
ounce of practice is worth a pound of precept.
But I have the purest confidence in you. I need
not appeal to the honour of four university men.
From my childhood upward, I have admired those
admirable institutions, and the knowledge of life
imparted by them. ‘Quid leges sine moribus?’
Excuse me; it is all the Latin I know.</p>

<p>“There is a raw Irishman among you, rather of

Every gentleman will be entitled to his own deal
desk, upon discharge of the bill, which he will find
made out in his name, in the drawer thereof. And
now farewell. I have been prolix in the endeavour
to be precise.</p>

<p>“There are no funds in hand for the London
branch, but our credit is unbounded. Push our
united interests, for I trust you to the last farthing.
I hope to find you with coffers full, and commercial
honour untainted, on the 31st of February prox.</p>

<p>“Believe me, Gentlemen, ever your affectionate

<p class="p1">“Consummate scoundrel!” exclaimed the little
Cantab, with the beard of an oyster in his throat.</p>

<p>“Detasteable heepocrite!” cried the representative
of Durham.</p>

<p>“Raw Irishman! Oh then the powers! And
the punch of the head I never giv’ him, a week
will be next Saturday.” Mr. OʼToole danced round
the room, caught up the desks like dolls, and
dashed all their noses together. Then he summoned
the landlord, and pelted him out of the room and
up the stairs with oyster&ndash;shells, the books, and the
whisky&ndash;bottle, and two pewter&ndash;pots after his legs,
as he luckily got round the landing&ndash;place. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
terrified man, and his wife worse frightened, locked
themselves in, and then threw up a window and
bawled out for the police.</p>

<p>Cradock, feeling ashamed of the uproar, seized
OʼToole by the collar; and the Durham man, being
sedate and steady, grasped him on the other side.
So they lifted him off the ground, and bore him
even into Hyde Park, and there they left him upon
a bench, and each went his several way. The
police, according to precedent, were in time to be
too late.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="p2">Cradock Nowell shivered hard, partly from
his cold, and partly at the thought of the bitter
life before him. He had Amyʼs five and sixpence
left, an immutable peculium. In currency his
means were limited to exactly four and ninepence.
With the accuracy of an upright man (even in the
smallest matters), he had forced upon Mr. OʼToole
his twopence, the quaternary of that letter. Also
he had insisted upon standing stout, when thirst
increased with oysters. Now he took the shillings
four, having lost all faith in his destiny, and put one
in each of his waistcoat pockets; for he had little
horse&ndash;shoes upwards, as well as the straight chinks
below. This being done, he disposed of his ninepence
with as tight a view to security.</p>

<p>All that day he wandered about, and regretted
Issachar Jupp. Towards nightfall, he passed a
railway terminus, miserably lighted, a disgrace to
any style of architecture, teeming with insolence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
pretence, dirt, discomfort, fuss, and confusion.
Let us call it the “Grand Junction Wasting and
Screwing Line;” because among railway companies
the name is generally applicable.</p>

<p>In a window, never cleaned since the prorogation
of Parliament, the following “Notice” tried to
appear; and, if you rubbed the glass, you might
read it.</p>

<p>“Wanted immediately, a smart active young
man, of good education. His duties will not be
onerous. Wages one pound per week. Uniform
allowed. Apply to Mr. Killquick, next door to the
booking&ndash;office.”</p>

<p>Cradock read this three times over, for his wits
were dull now, and then he turned round, and felt
whether all his money was safe. Yes, every blessed
halfpenny, for he had eaten nothing since the
oysters.</p>

<p>“Surely I am an active young man, of good
education,” said Crad to himself, “although not
very smart, perhaps, especially as to my boots; but
a suit, all uniform, allowed, will cure my only
deficiency. I could live and keep Wena comfortably
upon a pound a week. I hope, however, that
they cash up. Railway companies have no honour,
I know; but I suppose they pay when they canʼt
help it.”</p>

<p>Having meditated with himself thus much, he
went, growing excited on the way&mdash;for now he was
no philosopher&mdash;to the indicated whereabouts of
that lineʼs factotum, Mr. Killquick. Here he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
to wait very nearly an hour, Mr. Killquick being
engaged, as usual, in the companyʼs most active
department, arranging very effectually for a collision
down the line. “Successfully,” I would have
said; but, though the accident came off quite according
to the most sanguine, or sanguinary expectation,
the result was a slur on that companyʼs
fame; only three people being killed, and five&ndash;and&ndash;twenty
wounded.</p>

<p>“Now, young man,” asked Mr. Killquick, when
all his instructions were on the wires, “what is
your business with me?”</p>

<p>Cradock, having stated his purpose, name, and
qualifications, the traffic&ndash;manager looked at him
with interest and reflection. Then he said impressively,
“You can jump well, I should think?”</p>

<p>“I have never yet been beaten,” Crad answered,
“but of course there are many who <i>can</i> beat me.”</p>

<p>“And run, no doubt? And your sight is accurate,
and your nerves very good?”</p>

<p>“My nerves are not what they were, sir; but I
can run fast and see well.”</p>

<p>“Why do you shiver so? That will never do.
And the muscles of his calf are too prominent. We
lost No. 6 through that.”</p>

<p>“It is only a little cold I have caught. It will
go off in a moment with regular work.”</p>

<p>“You have no relation, I suppose, in any way
connected with the law? No friends, I mean, of
litigious tendencies?”</p>

<p>“Oh no. I have no friends whatever; none, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
mean, in London, only one family, far in the
country, to care at all about me.”</p>

<p>“No father or mother to make a fuss, eh? No
wife to prevent your attending to business?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, nothing of the sort. I am quite alone
in the world; and my life is of no importance.”</p>

<p>“Wonderful luck,” muttered Mr. Killquick;
“exactly the very thing for us! And I have been
so put out about that place, it has got such a reputation.
Poor Morshead cannot get through the
work any longer by himself. And the coroner
made such nasty remarks. If we kill another man
there before Easter, the <i>Times</i> will be sure to get
hold of it. Young man,” he continued in a louder
tone, “you are in luck this time, I believe. It is
a very snug situation; only you must look sharp
after your legs, and be sure you never touch spirits.
Not given to blue ruin, I hope?”</p>

<p>“Oh no. I never touch it.”</p>

<p>“Thatʼs right. I was afraid you did, you look
so down in the mouth. You can give us a reference,
I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes, to my landlady, Mrs. Ducksacre, a most
respectable person, in trade in Mortimer&ndash;street.”</p>

<p>“Good,” replied Mr. Killquick; “you mustnʼt
be alarmed, by the way, by any foolish rumours
you may hear as to dangers purely imaginary.
Your predecessor lost his life through the very
grossest carelessness. You are as safe there as in
your bed, unless your nerves happen to fail you.
And, when that is the case, I should like to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>,”
asked the traffic&ndash;manager indignantly, “which of
us is not in danger, even in coming down&ndash;stairs?”</p>

<p>“What will my duties be, then?” asked Cradock,
with some surprise.</p>

<p>“Why, you are not afraid, are you?” Mr.
Killquick looked at him contemptuously.</p>

<p>“No, I should rather hope not,” replied Cradock,
meeting him eye to eye, so that the wholesale
smasher quailed at him; “there is no duty, even
in a powder&ndash;mill, which I would shrink from now.”</p>

<p>“Ah, terrible things, those powder&ndash;mills! A
perfect disgrace to this age and country, their
wanton waste of human life. How the Legislature
lets them go on so, is more than I can conceive.
Why, they think no more of murdering
and maiming a dozen people&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Please, sir,” cried one of the clerks, coming
down from the telegraph office, “no end of a
collision on the Slayham and Bury Branch. Three
passengers killed, and twenty&ndash;five wounded, some
of them exceedingly fatally.”</p>

<p>“Bless my heart if I didnʼt expect it. Told
Sykes it would be so. Howʼs the engine,
Jemmy?”</p>

<p>“Sheʼs all right, sir; jumped over three carriages,
and went a header into a sand&ndash;hill. Driver
cased in glass, from vitrifaction of the sand.
Stoker took the hot water&mdash;a thing he ainʼt much
accustomed to.”</p>

<p>“No! What a capital joke. Hell&ndash;fire&ndash;Jack (I
can swear it was him), preserved in a glass case,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
from the results of his own imprudence! I shall
be up with you in five minutes, James. Be quite
ready to begin.”</p>

<p>“Now,” said Mr. Killquick, drawing out his
cigar&ndash;case, “I have little more to say to you, young
man, except that you can begin at eight oʼclock
to&ndash;morrow morning. We will dispense with the
references, for I have the utmost confidence in
you, and you will be searched very carefully every
time you come out of the gate&mdash;which you never
will be allowed to do, except when your spell is
over, and your mate is in. You will go at once to
our outfitters, and, upon presenting this ticket, they
will fit you up, as tightly as possible, with your
regimentals. And see that you donʼt take boots,
but the very best shoes for jumping in. What
they call ‘Oxford shoes’ are best, when tied tight
over the instep, and not too thick in the sole. No
nails, mind, for fear of slipping upon the flange.
Good&ndash;bye, my boy; be very careful. By&ndash;the&ndash;by,
you say you donʼt value your life?”</p>

<p>“Very little indeed,” said Cradock, “except
just for one reason.”</p>

<p>“Then now you must add another reason; you
must value it for our sake. The Company canʼt
have another inquest for at least six months. I
mean, of course, <i>by the same coroner</i>. Confound
that fellow; he will not take a right view of things.
At eight oʼclock to&ndash;morrow morning, you will be at
the gate of the Cramjam goods station. The clerk
there will have his orders about you. He will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
supply you with a book, and map out for you your
duties. Also Morshead, your mate, an invaluable
man, will show you the practical part of it. Now,
good&ndash;bye, my lad. Remember, you never wear any
except your official dress. We allow you two suits
in the twelvemonth. Your duties will be of a
refined character, and the exercise exhilarating. I
trust to receive a good report of you; and I hope,
my boy, that you are at peace, both with God and
man.”</p>

<p>Even Mr. Killquick had been touched a little
by Cradockʼs air of uncomplaining sorrow, and the
stamp of high mind and good breeding.</p>

<p>“Very foolish of me,” he muttered, as he lit his
cigar, and went up to telegraph to the Slayham
station&ndash;master&mdash;ʼCommit yourself to nothing;
observe the strictest economy; and no bonfires of
the splinter&ndash;wood, as they had last weekʼ&mdash;“very
foolish of me,” he said on the stairs, “but it goes
to my heart to kill that young fellow. How I
should like to know his history! That face does
not mean nothing.”</p>

<p>Cradock, caring very little what his duties might
be, and feeling the night&ndash;wind go through his heart,
hastened to the outfittersʼ, and there he was received
with a grin by an experienced shopman, on the
production of his note.</p>

<p>“Capital customers, sir,” he said; “famous
customers of ours, that Grand Junction Wasting
and Screwing Line, and the best of all for the
gentlemen in your way of business, sir. Must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
new clothes every new hand, and they changes
pretty often, sir. Pervides all the comforts of a
home for you, and a gentlemanly competence,
before youʼve been half a year with them.”</p>

<p>The man grinned still more at his own grim wit,
while Cradock stared at him in wonderment.</p>

<p>“Donʼt you see, sir, they canʼt pass the clothes
on, after the man has been killed, even if thereʼs a
bit of them left; for they must fit you like your
skin, sir. The leastest little wrinkle, sir, or the
ruffle of a hinch, or so much as the fray of a hem,
and there you are, sir; and they have to look for
another hactive young man, sir. And hactive
young men are getting shy, sir, uncommon shy of
it now, except they come from the country. Hope
you insured your life, sir, before taking the situation.
Thereʼs no company will accept your life
now, sir. What a nice young man the last were,&mdash;what
a nice young man, to be sure! outrageous
fond of filberts; till they cracked him, and found a
shell for him.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Cradock, whom the busy tailor had
been measuring all this while, “from all that you
tell me, there would be less imprudence in ordering
my coffin than to&ndash;morrowʼs dinner. What is
there so very dangerous in it?”</p>

<p>“Well, youʼll see, sir, youʼll see. I would not
frighten you for the world, because itʼs all up in a
moment, if you lose your presence of mind. Thank
you, sir; all right now, except the legs of the tights,
and thatʼs the most particular part of it all. May<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
I trouble you to turn your trousers up? It will
never do to measure over them. We shall put six
hands on at once at the job. The whole will be
ready at eleven this evening. You must kindly
call and try everything. We are ordered to insist
upon that.”</p>

<p>The next morning, Crad, in a suit of peculiar,
tough, and yet most elastic cord, which fitted him
as if he had been dipped in it, walked in at the
open gates of the front yard, leading to the Cramjam
general goods terminus. This was the only
way in or out (except along “the metals”), and, as
it was got up with heaps of stucco, all the porters
were very proud of it, and called it a “slap&ndash;up
harchway.”</p>

<p>“Stop, stop,” cried a sharp little fellow, gurgling
up, like a fountain, from among the sham pilasters;
“whatʼs your business here, my man, on the
premises of the Grand Junction Wasting and
Screwing Company? Ah, I see by your togs.
Just come this way, if you please, then.”</p>

<p>Here let me call a little halt, for time enough to
explain that the more fashionable of the railway
companies have lately agreed that a station&ndash;yard is
a sort of royal park, which cannot be kept too private,
which no doors may rashly open upon, a
pleasant rural solitude and weed&ndash;nursery for the
neighbourhood, and wherein the senior porter has
his private mushroom&ndash;bed. They are wise in this
seclusion, and wholesome is their privacy, so long
as they discard all principle&mdash;so long as they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
allowed to garotte us, while they jabber about
“public interests.” Perhaps, ere very long, we
shall have a modern Dædalus; and then the boards
of directors, so ready to do collectively things which,
done individually, no gentleman would own to, may
abate a few jots of their arrogance, and have faint
recollections of honour.</p>

<p>Cradock, not very deeply impressed by the
“compo” arch (about half the size of the stone one
at Nowelhurst Hallʼs chief entrance), presented
himself to the sharp little fellow, and told him
what he was come for.</p>

<p>“Glad to hear it,” said the gateman, “uncommonly
glad to hear it. Morshead is a wonderful
fellow; there is not another man in England could
have stuck to that work as he has done. He
ought to have five pounds a week, that he ought,
instead of a single sovereign. Screwing Co.”
(this was their common name) “will be sorry when
they have lost him. Now your duty is to enter, in
this here book, the number of every truck, jerry,
trod, or blinkem, tarpaulin, or covering of any sort;
also the destination chalked on it, and the nature
of the goods in the truck, so far as you can ascertain
them; coals, iron, chalk, packing&ndash;cases, boxes,
crates, what not, so fast as they comes into the higher
end, or so fast as they goes out of it. You return
this book to the check office every time you come
off duty. You begin work at eight in the morning,
and you leave at eight in the evening. You donʼt
pass here meanwhile, and you canʼt pass up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
line. Hope you have brought some grub. Youʼll
have five minutes in the afternoon, long enough to
get a snack in, after the up goods for Millstone is
off. Oh, you ought to have brought some grub;
if you faint, you will never come to again. But
perhaps Morshead can spare you a bit. Heʼll be
glad to see you, thatʼs certain, for he ainʼt slept a
wink for a week. And such a considerate chap.
I enter you in and out. ‘Number&ndash;taker 26.’ Thatʼs
all right from your cap, my lad. No room for it
on your sleeve. Might stick out, you know, and
you must pack tighter than any of the goods is.
‘Undertakers,’ we call you always. Good&ndash;bye, sir;
Morshead will tell you the rest, and I hope to see
you all right at eight <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> The first day is always
the worst. Go in at that door by the Pickford, and
ask the first porter you see for Morshead, and take
care how you get at him.”</p>

<p>Morshead was resting for a moment upon a
narrow piece of planking, amid a regular Seven
Dials of sidings, points, and turn&ndash;tables. Cradock
could scarcely see him, for trucks and vans and
boxes on wheels were gliding past in every direction,
thick as the carts on London Bridge, creaking,
groaning, ricketing, lurching; thumping up against
one another, and then recoiling with a heavy kick,
straining upon coupling&ndash;chains, butting against
bulkheads, staggering and jerking into grooves
and out of them, crushing flints into a shower of
sparks, doing anything and everything except
standing still for a moment. And among them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
rushed about, like dragons&mdash;ramping, and routing,
and swearing fearfully, gargling their throats with
a boiling riot, and then goring the ground with
tusks of steam, whisking and flicking their tails,
and themselves, in and out at the countless cross&ndash;webs,
screaming, and leaping, and rattling, and
booming&mdash;the great ponderous giant goods&ndash;engines.
Every man was out&ndash;swearing his neighbour, every
truck browbeating its fellow, every engine out&ndash;yelling
its rival. There is nothing on earth to
compare with this scene, unless it be the jostling
and churning of ice&ndash;packs in Davisʼs Straits, when
the tide runs hard, and a gale of wind is blowing,
and the floes have broken up suddenly. And even
that comparison fails, because, though the monsters
grind and crash, and labour and leap with agony,
they do not roar, and vomit steam, and swear at
one another.</p>

<p>At the risk of his life, for as yet he knew nothing
of the laws that governed their movements&mdash;a
very imperfect code, by&ndash;the&ndash;by&mdash;Cradock made
his way to the narrow staging where Morshead was
taking a breathing&ndash;time. His fellow “number&ndash;taker”
of course descried him coming; for he had
acquired the art of seeing all round, as a spider is
falsely supposed to do. He knew, in a moment,
by Cradockʼs dress, what business he was meant
for; and he said to himself, “Thank God!” in
one breath, for the sake of his wife and family;
and “Oh, poor fellow!” in the next, as he saw
how green our Cradock was. Then he held up his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
hands for Cradock to stop and waved them for him
to run; and so piloted him to the narrow knife&ndash;board,
“where a manʼs life was his own aʼmost.”</p>

<p>The highest and noblest of physical courage is
that which, fully perceiving the danger, looking
into the black pit of death, and seeing the night of
horrors there (undivested of horror by true religion),
encounters them all, treads the narrow cord
daily, not for the sake of honour or fortune; not
because of the dash in it, and the excitement to a
brave soul; not even to win the heartʼs maiden,
that pearl of romance and mystery: but simply to
supply the home, to keep in flow the springs of
love&mdash;whence the geyser heat is gone&mdash;to sustain
and comfort (without being comforted by them)
the wife, whose beauty is passed away, and who
may have taken to scold, and the children, whose
chief idea of daddy is that he has got a halfpenny.</p>

<p>This glorious inglorious courage, grander than
any that ever won medal or cross for destroying,
had a little home&mdash;though he knew it not, and
never thought about it&mdash;in the broad, well&ndash;rounded
bosom of simple Stephen Morshead. None but
himself knew his narrow escapes; an inch the
wrong way and he was a dead man, fifty times a
day. And worst of all in the night&mdash;oh, in the
horrible night, and yet more in the first gleam of
morning, when the body was worn out, and dreams
came over the eyes, but were death if they passed
to the brain, and the trucks went by like nightmares&mdash;that
very morning he had felt, after taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
duty night and day for more than a week, since
they killed his partner, he had felt that his Sally
must be a widow, and his seven children orphans, if
another night went over him without some relief
of sleep. That every word of this is true, many a
poor man would avouch (if he only had time and
the money to read it, and were not afraid); but
few rich men will care to swallow facts so indigestible.</p>

<p>Stephen Morshead was astonished at seeing that
his mate was come. None of the men in the goods
station would have anything to do with it. It was
very well to be up in the trucks, or upon the
engines, or even to act as switchman, for you had
a corner inviolable, and could only do mischief to
others. But to run in and out, and through and
through, in that perpetual motion, to be bound to
jot down every truck, the cover, and contents of it,
entering or departing from that crammed and
crowded terminus, to have nobody to help you
therein, and nobody to cry “dead man” if you
died, and the certainty that if you stood a hairʼs&ndash;breadth
out of the perpendicular, or a single wheel
had a bunion, you with the note&ndash;book in your hand
must flood the narrow ‘tween&ndash;ways, and find your
way out underneath to heaven; all this, and the
risk of the fearful jumps from one sliding train to
another, sliding oppositely, and jerking, perhaps, as
you jumped; and yet if you funked the jump you
must be crushed, like a frog beneath a turf&ndash;beater:
these considerations, after many pipes were smoked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
over them, had induced all the porters and stokers
to dwell on the virtues of the many men killed,
and to yield to their wives’ entreaties, acquiesce in
their sixteen shillings, nor aspire to the four shillings
Charon&ndash;fare.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Morshead, “shake hands with me,”
as Cradock, breathless with running wonder, leaped
upon the nine&ndash;inch gangway. “I see you belongs
to a different horder of society; obliged to keep my
eyes open, mate; but, as long as you and I works
together, I ask it as a favour of you, to shake hands
night and morning.”</p>

<p>“With the greatest pleasure,” said Cradock,
“if you think thereʼs room for our funny&ndash;bones.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” laughed Morshead, “you are the
right sort for it. Not a bit afeard, I see. Now I
mustnʼt stop to talk; just follow me, and do as I
do. I can put you up to it in six hours; and then
if you can spare me for the other six, ‘twill be the
saving of the little ones. But tell the truth if youʼre
tired. I should scorn myself if harm came to you.”</p>

<p>“You are the bravest man I ever met,” said
Cradock, with his heart rising; “you cannot expect
me to be like you. But you shall not find me
a coward.”</p>

<p>“I can see it by your eyes, lad. No sparkle, but
a glowing like. I can always tell by the eyes of a
man how long he will last at this work. Now
come along o’ me, and Iʼll show you the nine worst
crushing places.”</p>

<p>Cradock followed him through the threads&mdash;threads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
of Clotho and Atropos&mdash;feeling the way
with his legs, like a gnat who “overs the posts” of
a spiderʼs web. In and out, with a jump here
and there, when two side&ndash;boards threatened to
shear them, they got to the gorge at the entrance,
where the main turmoil of all was. The Symplegades
were a joke to it. And all because the
Screwing Company would not buy land enough to
get elbow room. There are several lines of railway
which do a much larger business; there is no
other which attempts to do so much upon less than
four times the acreage.</p>

<p>“Iʼve tottled all them as are going out,” Mr.
Morshead informed Cradock; “now youʼll see how
we enters them as they enters.”</p>

<p>Laughing at his own very miserable joke, he
leaped on the chains of the passing waggons, and
held up his hand for Cradock not to attempt to do
the same.</p>

<p>“Takes a deal of practice that,” he cried, after
he had crossed the train; “it ainʼt like a passenger&ndash;train,
you know; and you must larn when they are
standing. I need not to have done it now, but sometimes
I be forced. Bide where you are; no danger
unless they comes with the flaps down.”</p>

<p>Then he jotted down, with surprising quickness,
all the necessary particulars of the train that was
coming in. It happened to be an easy one; for
there were no tarpaulins at all, and it was not
travelling faster than about four miles an hour.</p>

<p>“Some drivers there is,” said Morshead, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
rejoined Cradock round the tail of the train,
“who really seem to want to kill a fellow, they
come by at such a pace, without having any call for
it. I believe they think, the low fools, that we are
put as spies upon them, and they would rather kill
us than not.&mdash;Hold your tongue,” to a man in a
truck, who was interrupting his lecture; “donʼt
you know better than to offer <i>me</i> that stuff? Never
touch what they offers you, sir. They means no
harm, but you had safer take poison when you be
on duty. There is not much real danger <i>just here</i>,
if a fellow is careful, because the rails run parallo;
there is nothing round the curve now, I see, and
only two coming out, and both of they be scored;
itʼs a rare chance to show you the figures of eight,
and slide&ndash;points where the chief danger is. Show
you where poor Charley was killed last week, and
how he did it.”</p>

<p>“Poor fellow! Did he leave any family?”</p>

<p>“Twelve in all. No man comes here, unless he
be tired of his life, or be druv to it by the little ones.”</p>

<p>“And what did the Company do for them?”</p>

<p>“Oh, behaved most ‘andsome <i>for them</i>. Allowed
‘em two bob a week for a twelvemonth to come&mdash;twopence
apiece all round. But they only did it
to encourage me, for fear I should funk off. I
have seen out three mates now. Please God, I
shanʼt see you out too, my lad.”</p>

<p>“If you do, it shanʼt be from funk, Morshead.
I rather like the danger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Thatʼs the worst thing of all,” replied Stephen;
“I beg of you not to say that, sir.”</p>

<p>A thoroughly brave man almost always has respect
for order. The bold man&mdash;which means a
coward with jumps in him&mdash;generally has none.
It was strange to see how Stephen Morshead, in all
that crush, and crash, and rattle, that swinging
and creaking as of the Hellespontic boat&ndash;bridge,
mixed deference with his pity for Cradock. He
saw, from his face, and air, and manner, that he was
bred a gentleman. Shall we ever come&mdash;or rather
the twentieth generation come&mdash;to the time when
every man of England (but for his own fault)
shall be bred and trained a gentleman in the true
and glorious sense of it?</p>

<p>Cradock saw the fatal places, where the sleepers
still were purple, where danger ran in converging
lines, where a man must stand sideways, like a
duellist, and with his arms in like a drill&ndash;sergeantʼs,
and not shrink an inch from the driving&ndash;wheels;
where his size was measured as for his coffin, and
if he stirred he would want nothing more. Then,
if a single truck&ndash;flap were down, if an engine
rollicked upon the rail, if a broad north&ndash;country
truck, overreaching, happened to be in either
train, when you were caught between the two, your
only chance was to cry, “Good God!” and lie
upon your side, and straighten all your toes out.</p>

<p>And yet these were the very places where, most
of all, the “number&ndash;taker” was bound to have his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
stand&mdash;where alone he could contrive to check
two trains at once. “Could they help starting
two trains at once?” poor Crad asked himself&mdash;for
he had found no time to ask it before&mdash;when,
weary to the last fibre with the work of the day,
he fell upon his little bed, and could hardly notice
Wena. Perhaps they could not; it was more
than he knew; only he knew that, if they could,
they were but wanton man&ndash;slaughterers.</p>

<p>After a deep sleep, all in his clothes, he awoke
the next morning quite up for his work, and
Morshead, who had been on duty all night, and
whose eyes seemed cut out of card&ndash;board, only
stayed for an hour with him, and then, feeling
that Crad was quite up to the day&ndash;work, ran home
and snored for ten hours, as loud as Phlegethon or
Enceladus.</p>

<p>The most fearful thing, for a new hand, was, of
course, the night&ndash;work; and Stephen Morshead,
delighted to have such a mate at last, had begged
to leave Cradock the day&ndash;spell, at least for the
first three weeks; for to Stephen the moon was as
good as the sun, and sweet sleep fell like wool
when plucked at, and hushed the tramping steeds
of the day&ndash;god. Only, for the sake of Stephenʼs
eyes, on whose accuracy hung the life&ndash;poise, it
was absolutely necessary not to dilate the pupils
incessantly.</p>

<p>But Cradock never took night&ndash;work there; and
the change came about on this wise. Wena felt
that she was wronged by his going away from her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
every day so early in the morning, and not coming
home to her again till ever so late at night, and
then too tired to say a word, or perhaps he didnʼt
care to do it. Like all females of any value&mdash;unless
they are really grand ones, and, if such there
be, please to keep them away&mdash;Wena grew jealous
desperately. She might as well be anybody elseʼs
dog; and the bakerʼs dog was with his master all day;
and the butcherʼs lady dog, a nasty ill&ndash;bred thing&mdash;the
idea of calling her a lady!&mdash;why, even she was
allowed, though the selfish thing didnʼt care for
it, unless there was suet on his apron, to jump up
at him and taste him, all the time he was going
for orders. And then look even at the Ducksacre
dog, a despicable creature&mdash;his father might have
been a bull&ndash;terrier, or he might have been a Pomeranian,
or a quarter&ndash;bred Skye, or the Lord knows
who, very likely a turnspit, and his mother, oh!
the less we say of her the better;&mdash;why, that
wretched, lop&ndash;eared, split&ndash;tailed thing, without an
eye fit to look out of, had airs of his own; and
what did it mean, she would like to know, and she
who had formed some nice acquaintances, dogs
that had been presented at Court, and got Eau&ndash;de&ndash;Cologne
every morning, and not a blessed [run
away] upon them? Why, it meant simply this:
that Spot, filthy plague&ndash;spot, was allowed to go
out with the baskets, and made a deal of by his
owners, and might cock his tail with the best of
them, while she, black Wena, who had been
brought up so differently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Here her feelings were too much for her, and
she put down her soft flossy ear upon the drugget&ndash;scrap,
and looked at the door despairingly, and
howled until Mrs. Ducksacre was obliged to come
up and comfort her. Even then she wouldnʼt eat
the dripping.</p>

<p>From that day she made her mind up. She
would watch her opportunity. What was the
good of being endowed with such a nose as she
had, unless she could smell her master out, even
through the streets of London? What did he wear
such outlandish clothes for? Very likely, on purpose
to cheat her. Very likely he was even keeping
some other dog. At any rate, she would know
that, if it cost her her life to do it. What good
was her life now to her, or anybody else?
Heigho!</p>

<p>On the following Saturday, when Cradock was
gone to his fifth dayʼs work, what does Wena do,
when Mrs. Ducksacre came up on purpose to coax
and make much of her, but most ungratefully give
her the slip, with a skill worthy of a better purpose,
then scuttle down the stairs, all four legs at once,
in that sort of a bone&ndash;slide which domestic dogs
acquire. Miss Ducksacre ran out of the shop at
the noise&mdash;for this process is not a silent one; but
she could only cry, “Oh, Lord!” as Wena, with
the full impact of her weight multiplied into her
velocity; or, if that is wrong, with the cube of her
impetus multiplied into the forty&ndash;two stairs&mdash;bang
she came anyhow, back&ndash;foremost, against the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
ladyʼs&mdash;nay, you there, I said, “lower limbs”&mdash;and
deposited her in a bushel of carrots, just come
from Covent Garden.</p>

<p>“Stop her, Joe, for Godʼs sake, stop her!”
Miss Ducksacre cried to the shop&ndash;boy, as well as
she could, for the tail of a carrot which had
gotten between her teeth.</p>

<p>“Blowed if I can, miss,” the boy responded, as
Wena nipped his fingers for him; the next moment
she was free as the wind, and round the corner in
no time.</p>

<p>“Oh dear, oh dear,” cried Polly Ducksacre, a
buxom young lady, with fine black eyes, “whatever
will Mr. Newman think of us? It will seem
so unkind and careless; and he does love that dog
so!”</p>

<p>Polly was beginning to entertain a tender regard
for Cradock; especially since he had shown his
proportions in “them beautiful buff pantaloons.”
What a greengrocer he would make, to be sure, so
hupright and so lordly like; and sheʼd like to see
the man in the “Garden” who would tell her she
had eaten sparrow&ndash;pie, with Mr. Newman to hold
the basket for her.</p>

<p>By this time, Mrs. Ducksacre was come down the
stairs, screaming “Wena!” at the top of her voice
the whole way; and out they ran, boy and all, to
search for her, while three or four urchins came in,
without medium of exchange, and filled cap,
mouth, and pocket. One brat was caught upon
their return, and tied up for the day in an empty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
potato&ndash;sack, and exposed, behind the counter, to
universal execration; in which position he took
such note of manner and custom, time and place,
that it was never safe for the Ducksacre firm to
dine together afterwards.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, that little black Wena, responsive
and responsible to none except her master, pursued
the even tenor of her way, nosing the ground, and
asking many a question of the lamp&ndash;posts, as far as
the Cramjam Terminus, at least three miles from
Mortimer&ndash;street. The sharp little gate&ndash;clerk, animated
with railway love of privacy, ran out, and
clapped his hands, and shouted “hoo” at Wena;
but she only buttoned her tail down, and cut across
the compound. As for the stone he threw at her,
she caught it up in her mouth as it rolled, and
carried it on to her master.</p>

<p>There was Cradock, in the thick of it, standing
on a narrow pile of pig&ndash;iron, one of his chief
fortalices; his book was in his hand, and he was
entering, as fast as he could, all the needful
particulars of a goods train sliding past him.</p>

<p>Creak, and squeak, and puff, and shriek,&mdash;Oh,
what a scene, thought Wena,&mdash;and the rattle of
the ghostly chains, and the rushing about, and the
roaring. She lost her presence of mind in a
moment,&mdash;she always had been such a nervous
dog&mdash;she tightened her tail convulsively, and
dropped her ears, while her eyes came forth; and,
glancing at the horrors on every side, she fled for
dear life from the evil to come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>The faster she fled, the more they closed round
her. She had not espied her master yet; she could
not find the way back again; she was terrified out
of all memory; and a host of frightful genii, more
sooty than Cocytus, and riding hideous monsters,
were yelling at her on every side, clapping black
hands, and hooting. The dog on the Derby course,
when the race rushes round the corner, was in a
position of glory and safety compared to poor
Wenaʼs now. Already the tip of her tail was
crushed, already one pretty paw was broken; for
she had bolted in and out through the trains, truck
bottoms, wheels, and driving&ndash;wheels. Oh, you
cowards, to yell at her! with black death grating
and grinding upon her soft silky back!</p>

<p>At last, she gave in altogether. They had
hunted her to her grave. Who may contend with
destiny? She lay down under a moving coal&ndash;train,
and resigned herself to die. But first she must
ask for sympathy, although so unlikely to get it.
She looked once more at her wounded foot, and
shivered and sobbed with the agony; and then
gave vent to one long low cry, to ask if no one
loved a poor dog there.</p>

<p>Cradock heard it, and started so that it was
nearly all up with him too. Thoroughly he knew
the cry, wherein she had wailed for Clayton. He
flung down his book, and dashed to the place, and
there he saw Wena, and she saw him. She began
to try to limp to him, but he held up his hand to
stop her; disabled as she was, she was sure to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
caught by the wheel. Could she stay there, and
let the train pass her? No. At its tail was an
empty horse&ndash;box, almost scraping the ground, perfectly
certain to crush her. Crying, “Down,
down, my poor darling!” he ran down the train,
which was travelling seven or eight miles an hour,
seized the side of a truck, and leaped, at the risk of
his life, upon the fender in front of the horse&ndash;box.
Then he got astride of the coupling&ndash;chain, and
kept his right hand low to the ground, to snatch
her up ere the crusher came. Knowing where she
was, he caught her by the neck the instant the
truck disclosed her, and, with a strong swing,
heaved her up into it. But he lost his balance in
doing it, and fell sideways, with his head on the
other coupling&ndash;chain. Stunned by the blow, he
lay there, only clinging by his right calf to the
chain he had sat astride upon. The first jerk of
either chain, the first swing of either carriage, and
he must be ground to powder.</p>

<p>Luckily for him and for Amy, Morshead was
not gone home yet, seeing more to do than usual.
Missing his mate from the proper place, he had run
up in terror to look for him, when a man in a truck,
who had vainly been shouting to stop the coal&ndash;trainʼs
engine, pointed and screamed to him where
and what was doing. Morshead jumped on the
heap of pig&ndash;iron, and sideways thence on the board
of the truck just passing, as dangerous a leap as
well could be, but luckily that truck was empty.
He jumped into the truck, a shallow one, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
poor Wena lay quite paralysed, and, stooping over
the back with both arms, he got hold of Cradockʼs
collar. Then, with a mighty effort, he jerked him
upon the tail&ndash;board, and lugged him in, and bent
over him.</p>

<p>Wounded Wena crawled up, and begged to have
her poor foot looked at, then, obtaining no notice
at all, she felt that Cradock must be killed and
dead, just as Clayton had been. Upon this conclusion,
she fetched such a howl, though it shook
her sore tail to do it, that the engine&ndash;driver actually
looked round, and the train was stopped.</p>

<p>Hereupon, let me offer a suggestion&mdash;everybody
now is allowed to do so, though nobody ever takes
it. My suggestion is, that no man should be
allowed to drive an engine without having served
a twelvemonthʼs apprenticeship as an omnibus conductor.
I donʼt mean to say it would improve his
morals&mdash;probably rather otherwise; but it would
teach him the habit of looking round; it would let
him know that there really is more than one quarter
of the heavens. At present, all engine&ndash;drivers seem
afraid of being turned into pillars of salt. So they
fix themselves, like pillars of stone, and stare,
<i>ἀχηνίαις ὀμμάτων</i>, through their square glass spectacles.</p>

<p>When one of the railway bajuli&mdash;who are, on
the whole, very good sort of fellows, and deserve
their Christmas&ndash;boxes&mdash;came home in the cab with
Cradock and Wena at the expense of the Company
(which was boasted of next board&ndash;day)&mdash;when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
one of them came home with Crad&mdash;for Morshead
had double work again&mdash;Polly Ducksacre went
into strong hysterics, and it required two married
men and a boy to get her out of the potato&ndash;bin.</p>

<p>It was all up with our Crad that night. The
overwork of brain and muscle, the presence of
mind required all the time when his mind was
especially absent, the impossibility of thinking out
any of his trains of ideas when a train of trucks
was upon him, the native indignation of a man at
knowing that his blood is meant to ebb down a
railway sewer, and a new broom will sweep him
clean&mdash;all these worries and wraths together, cogging
into the mill&ndash;wheel of cares already grinding,
had made such a mill&ndash;clack in his head near the
left temple, where the thump was, that he could
only roll on his narrow bed at imminent risk of a
floor&ndash;bump.</p>

<p>Then the cold, long harbouring, struck into his
heart and reins; and he knew not that Dr. Tink
came, and was learned and diagnostic upon him;
nor even that Polly Ducksacre took his feet out of
bed, and rubbed them until her wrists gave way;
and then, half ashamed of her womanhood, sneaked
away, and cried over Wena.</p>

<p>Wenaʼs foot was put into splinters, Wenaʼs tail
was stypticised; but no skill could save her master
from a furious brain&ndash;fever.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="p2">Leaving the son on his narrow hard pallet, to
toss and toss, and turn and turn, and probably get
bed&ndash;sores, let us see how the father was speeding.</p>

<p>Sir Cradock Nowell sat all alone in his little
breakfast&ndash;room, soon after the funeral of his
brother, and before Eoa came to him. For the
simple, hot&ndash;hearted girl fell so ill after she heard of
her loss, and recovered from the narcotic, that
Biddy OʼGaghan, who got on famously with the
people at the Crown, would not hear of her being
moved yet, and drove Dr. Hutton all down the
stairs, “with a word of sinse on the top of him,”
when he claimed his right of attending upon the
girl he had known in India.</p>

<p>That little breakfast&ndash;room adjoined Sir Cradockʼs
favourite study, and was as pretty a little room as
he could have wished to sit in. He had made pretence
of breakfasting, but perhaps he looked forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
to lunch&ndash;time, for not more than an ounce of
food had he swallowed altogether.</p>

<p>There he sat nervously, trying vainly to bring
his mind to bear on the newspaper. Fine gush of
irony, serried antithesis, placid assumption of the
point at issue, then logic as terse and tight as the
turns of a three&ndash;inch screw&ndash;jack, withering indignation
at those who wonʼt think exactly as we do,
the sunrise glow of metaphor, the moonlight gleam
of simile, the sparkling stars of wit, and the playful
Aurora of humour&mdash;alas, all these are like
water on a duckʼs back when the heart wonʼt let
the brain go. If we cannot appreciate their beauty,
because our opinions are different, how can we
hope to do so when we donʼt care what any opinions
are?</p>

<p>It is all very well, very easy, to talk about
objectivity; but a really objective man the Creator
has never shown us, save once; and even He rebuked
the fig&ndash;tree, to show sympathy with our
impatience.</p>

<p>And I doubt but it is lest we deify the grand
incarnations of intellect&mdash;the Platos and the Aristotles,
the Bacons and the Shakespeares&mdash;that it
has pleased the Maker of great and small to leave
us small tales of the great ones, mean anecdotes,
low traditions; lest at any time we should be dazzled,
and forget that they were but sparkles from
the dross which heaven hammers on. Oh vast and
soaring intellects, was it that your minds flew
higher because they had shaken the soul off; or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
was it that your souls grew sullen at the mindʼs
preponderance?</p>

<p>Fash we not ourselves about it, though we pay
the consequences. If we have not those great
minds in the lump, we have a deal more, taking
the average, and we make it go a deal further,
having learned the art of economy and the
division of labour. Nevertheless, Sir Cradock
Nowell, being not at all an objective man, lay deep
in the pot of despondency; and, even worse than
that, hung, jerked thereout every now and then,
by the flesh&ndash;hook of terror and nervousness. How
could he go kindly with his writer when his breakfast
would not so with him?</p>

<p>He was expecting Bull Garnet. Let alone all
his other wearing troubles, he never could be comfortable
when he expected Bull Garnet. At every
step in the passage, every bang of a door, the proud
old gentleman trembled and flushed, and was wroth
with himself for doing so.</p>

<p>Then Hogstaff came in, and fussed about, and
Sir Cradock was fain to find fault with him.</p>

<p>“How careless you are getting about the letters,
Hogstaff. Later and later every morning! What
is the reason that you never now bring me the bag
at the proper time?”</p>

<p>It was very strange, no doubt, of Job Hogstaff,
but he could not bear to be found fault with; and
now he saw his way to a little triumph, and resolved
to make the most of it.</p>

<p>“Yes, Sir Cradock; to be sure, Sir Cradock;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
how my old head is failing me! Very neglectful
of me never to have brought the bag to&ndash;day.”
Then he turned round suddenly at the door, to
which he had been hobbling. “Perhaps youʼd look
at the date, Sir Cradock, of the paper in your hand,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Yesterdayʼs paper, of course, Hogstaff. What
has that to do with it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing, sir, nothing, of course. Only I
thought it might have comed in the letter&ndash;bag.
Perhaps it never does, Sir Cradock; you knows
best, as you takes it out.” Here old Job gave a
quiet chuckle, and added, as if to himself, “No, of
course, it couldnʼt have come in the letter&ndash;bag this
morning, or master would never have blowed me
up for not bringing him the bag, as nobody else
got a key to it!”</p>

<p>“How stupid of me, to be sure, how excessively
stupid!” exclaimed Sir Cradock, with a sigh; “of
course I had the bag, a full hour ago; and there
was nothing in it but this paper. Job, I beg your
pardon.”</p>

<p>“And I hope itʼs good news youʼve got there,
Sir Cradock, and no cases of starvation; no one
found dead in the streets, I hopes, or drownded in
the Serpentine. Anyhow, thereʼs a many births, I
see, and a deal too many. Children be now such
a plenty nobody care about them.”</p>

<p>“Job, you quite forget yourself,” said his
master, very grandly; but there came a long sigh
after it, and Job was not daunted easily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>“And, if I do, Sir Cradock Nowell, Iʼd sooner
forget myself than my children.”</p>

<p>Sir Cradock was very angry, or was trying to
feel that he ought to be so, when a heavy tread,
quite unmistakable, and yet not so firm as it used
to be, shook the Minton tiles of the passage. That
step used to cry to the echoes, “Make way; a man
of vigour and force is coming.” Now all it said
was, “Here I go, and am not in a mood to be
meddled with.”</p>

<p>“Come in,” said Sir Cradock, fidgeting, and
pretending to be up for an egg, as Mr. Garnet
gave two great thumps on the panel of the door.
Small as the room was, Job Hogstaff managed to
be too late to let him in.</p>

<p>Bull Garnet first flung his great eyes on the
butler; he had no idea of fellows skulking their
duty. Old Hogstaff, who looked upon Garnet
as no more than an upper servant, gazed back
with especial obtuseness, and waved his napkin
cleverly.</p>

<p>“Please to put that mat straight again, Mr.
Garnet. You kicked it askew, as you came in.
And our master canʼt abide things set crooked.”</p>

<p>To Jobʼs disappointment and wonder, Bull
Garnet stepped back very quietly, stooped down,
and replaced the sheepskin.</p>

<p>“Hogstaff, leave the room this moment,” shouted
Sir Cradock, wrathfully; and Job hobbled away to
brag how he had pulled Muster Garnet down a
peg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, Garnet, take my easy&ndash;chair. Will you
have a cup of coffee after your early walk?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you. I have breakfasted three
hours and a half ago. In our position of life, we
must be up early, Sir Cradock Nowell.”</p>

<p>There was something in the tone of that last
remark, common&ndash;place as it was, without the key
to it, which the hearer disliked particularly.</p>

<p>“I have requested the favour of your attendance
here, Mr. Garnet, that I might have the benefit of
your opinion upon a subject which causes me the
very deepest anxiety&mdash;at least, I mean, which interests
me deeply.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed Mr. Garnet: he could say
“ah!” in such a manner that it held three volumes
uncut.</p>

<p>“Yes. I wish to ask your opinion about my
poor son, Cradock.”</p>

<p>Bull Garnet said not a word, but conveyed to
the ceiling his astonishment that the housemaid
had left such cobwebs there.</p>

<p>“I fear, Garnet, you cannot sympathize with
me. You are so especially fortunate in your own
domestic circumstances.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Mr. Garnet, still contemplating the
cornice. “<i>Oh exclamantis est</i>,” beautifully observes
the Eton grammar.</p>

<p>“Yes, your son is a perfect pattern. So gentle
and gentlemanly; so amiable and poetical. I had
no idea he was so brave. Shall I ever see him to
thank him for saving the life of my niece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>“He is a fine fellow, a noble fellow, Sir Cradock.
The dearest and the best boy in the whole wide
world.”</p>

<p>The old man long had known that the flaw in
Bull Garnetʼs armour was the thought of his dear
boy, Bob.</p>

<p>“And can you not fancy, Garnet, that my son,
whatever he is, may also be dear to me?”</p>

<p>“I should have said so, I must have thought so,
but for the way you have treated him.”</p>

<p>Bull Garnet knew well enough that he was a
hot and hasty man; but he seldom had felt that
truth more sharply than now, when he saw the
result of his words. Nevertheless, he faltered not.
He had made up his mind to deliver its thoughts,
and he was not the man to care for faces.</p>

<p>“Sir Cradock Nowell, I am a violent, hot, and
passionate man. I have done many things in my
fury which I would give my life to undo; but I
would rather have them all on my soul than such
cold&ndash;blooded, calm, unnatural cruelty as you have
shown to your only&mdash;I mean to your own&mdash;son. I
suppose you never cared for him; <i>suppose!</i> I mean
of course you did not.”</p>

<p>He looked at Sir Cradock Nowell, with thunder
and hail in his eyes. The old man could not glance
it back; neither did he seem to be greatly indignant
at it.</p>

<p>“Then&mdash;then&mdash;I suppose you donʼt think&mdash;you
donʼt believe, I mean, Garnet&mdash;that he did it <i>on
purpose</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>Mr. Garnet turned pale as a winding&ndash;sheet, and
could not speak for a moment. Then he looked
away from Sir Cradockʼs eyes, and asked, “Is it
possible that <i>you</i> have ever thought so?”</p>

<p>“I have tried not,” answered Sir Cradock, with
his wasted bosom heaving. “God knows that I
have struggled against it. Garnet, have pity upon
me. If you have any of our blood in you, tell me
the truth, what you think.”</p>

<p>“I not only think, but know, that the devil only
could have suggested such an idea to you. Man,
for the sake of the God that made you, and made
me as well as your brother, and every one of us
brethren, rather put a pistol to your heart than
that damned idea. In cold blood! in cold blood!
And for the sake of gain! A brother to&mdash;do away
with&mdash;a brother so! Oh, what things have come
upon me! Where is my God, and where is
yours?”</p>

<p>“I am sure I donʼt know,” replied the old man,
gazing round in wonderment, as if he expected to
see Him&mdash;for the scene had quite unnerved him&mdash;“I
suppose He is&mdash;is somewhere in the usual place,
Mr. Garnet.”</p>

<p>“Then thatʼs not in this neighbourhood,” replied
Bull Garnet, heavily; “He is gone from me, from
all of us. And His curse is on my children. Poor
innocents, poor helpless lambs! The curse of God
is on them.”</p>

<p>He went away to the window; and, through his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
tears, and among the trees, tried to find his cottage&ndash;roof.</p>

<p>Sir Cradock Nowell was lost to thought, and
heard nothing of those woeful words, although from
the depth of that labouring chest they came like
the distant sea&ndash;roar.</p>

<p>Bull Garnet returned with his fierce eyes softened
to a womanʼs fondness, and saw, with pity as
well as joy, that his last words had not been heeded.
“Ever hot and ever hasty, until it comes to my
own death,” he muttered, still in recklessness;
“perhaps then I shall be tardy. For my sonʼs
sake, for my Bob and Pearl, I must not make such a
child of myself. Nevertheless, I cannot stay here.”</p>

<p>“Garnet,” said Sir Cradock Nowell, slowly recovering
from his stupor, a slight cerebral paralysis,
“say nothing of what has passed between us&mdash;nothing,
I entreat you; and not another word to me
now. I only understand that you assert emphatically
my son Cradockʼs innocence.”</p>

<p>“With every fibre of my heart. With every
tissue of my brain.”</p>

<p>“Then I love you very much for it; although
you have done it so rudely.”</p>

<p>“Donʼt say that. Never say it again. I canʼt
bear it now, Sir Cradock.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then, I wonʼt, Garnet. Though I
think you might be proud of my gratitude; for I
never bestow it rashly.”</p>

<p>“I am very thankful to you. Gratitude is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
admirable and exceedingly scarce thing. I am
come to give you notice&mdash;as well as to answer your
summons&mdash;notice of my intention to quit your
service shortly.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” replied Sir Cradock, gasping;
“nonsense, Garnet! You never mean that&mdash;that
even you would desert me?”</p>

<p>Bull Garnet was touched by the old manʼs tone&mdash;the
helplessness, the misery. “Well,” he answered,
“Iʼll try to bear with it for a little longer,
in spite of the daily agony. I owe you everything;
all I can do. Iʼll get things all into first&ndash;rate
order, and then I hope, most truly, your son will
be back again, sir.”</p>

<p>“It isnʼt only the stewardship, Garnet; it isnʼt
only that. You are now as one of the family, and
there are so few of us left. Your daughter Pearl;
I begin to love her as of my own flesh and blood.
Who knows but what, if my Cradock comes back,
he may take a liking to her? Amy Rosedew has
not behaved well lately, any more than her father
has.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that you, Sir Cradock,
with all your prejudices of birth, legitimacy, and
station, would ever sanction&mdash;supposing it possible&mdash;any
affection of a child of yours for a child of
mine?”</p>

<p>“To be sure&mdash;if it were a true one. A short
time ago I thought very differently. But oh!
what does it matter? I am not what I was,
Garnet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Neither am I,” thought Mr. Garnet; “but I
might have been, if only I could ever have dreamed
this. God has left me, for ever left me.”</p>

<p>“Why donʼt you answer me, Garnet? Why do
you shut your Pearl up so? Let her come to me
soon; she would do me good; and I, as you know,
have a young lady coming, who knows little of
English society. Pearl would do her a great deal
of good. Pearl is a thorough specimen of a well&ndash;bred
English maiden. I think I like her better
than Amy&mdash;since Amy has been so cold to me.”</p>

<p>To Sir Cradockʼs intense astonishment, Bull
Garnet, instead of replying, rushed straight away
out of the room, and, not content with that, he
rushed out of the house as well, and strode fiercely
away to the nearest trees, and was lost to sight
among them.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the old man, “he always was the
oddest fellow I ever did know; and I suppose he
always will be. And yet what a man for business!”</p>

<p>That same forenoon, Mrs. Brownʼs boy and
donkey came with a very long message from a lady
who had tucked him on the head because he could
not make out her meaning. He believed her
name was Mrs. Jogging, and he was to say that
Miss Oh Ah was fit to come home to&ndash;day, please,
if theyʼd please to send the shay for her. And
they must please to get ready Satanʼs room, where
the daffodil curtains was, because the young
woman loved to look at the yeast, and to have
a good fire burning. And please they must send<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
the eel&ndash;skin cloak, and the foot&ndash;tub in the shay,
because the young woman was silly.</p>

<p>“Chilly, you stupid,” replied Mrs. Toaster.
“She shall have the foot&ndash;warmer and the seal&ndash;skin
cloak; but what Satanʼs room with the daffodil
curtains is, only the Lord in heaven knows; and
how she is to see any yeast there! Are you certain
that was the message?”</p>

<p>“Sartin, maʼam. I said it to myself ever so
many times; more often than I stuck the Neddy.”</p>

<p>Sir Cradock Nowell, upon appeal, speedily decided
that the satin room was meant&mdash;the room
with the rose&ndash;coloured curtains, and the windows
facing the east; but the boy stuck out for the
daffodil; leastways he was certain it was <i>some</i>
flower.</p>

<p>It was nearly dark when the carriage returned;
and Sir Cradock came down to the great entrance&ndash;hall
to meet his brotherʼs child. He was trembling
with anxiety; for his nerves were rapidly
failing him; and, from Dr. Huttonʼs account, he
feared to see in his probable heiress&mdash;for now
he had no heir&mdash;something very outlandish and
savage. Therefore he was surprised and delighted
when a graceful and beautiful girl, with high
birth and elegance in every movement, flung off
her cloak, and skipped up to him with the lightness
of a gazelle, and threw her arms round his neck,
and kissed him.</p>

<p>“Oh, uncle, I shall love you so! You are so
like my darling&mdash;you have got his nose exactly, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
just the same shaped legs. Oh, to think he should
ever have left me!” And she burst into tears then
and there before half a dozen servants. “Oh,
Uncle Cradock, you have got a fine house; but I
never shall get over it.”</p>

<p>“Hush, my dear; come with me, my child!”
Sir Cradock was always wide awake upon the subject
of proprieties.</p>

<p>“I am not your child; and I wonʼt be your
child, if you try to stop me like that. I must
cry when I want to cry, and it is so stupid to stop
me.”</p>

<p>“What a pretty dear you are!” said Sir Cradock,
scarcely knowing what to say, but having
trust in feminine vanity.</p>

<p>“Am I indeed? I donʼt think so at all. I was
very pretty, I know, until I began to cry so. But
now my cheeks are come out, and my eyes gone
in; but, oh dear! what does it matter, and my
father never, never to take me on his lap again?
Hya! Hya! Hya!”</p>

<p>“Faix, thin, me darlinʼ,” cried Mrs. OʼGaghan,
stroking her down in a shampoo manner, “itʼs
meself as knows how to dale with you. Lave her
to me; Sir Crayduck; sheʼs pure and parfict, every
bit on her. I knows how to bring her out, and
sheʼll come to your room like a lamb, now jist.&mdash;Git
out of the way, the lot on you”&mdash;to several
officious maidens&mdash;“me honey, put your hand in
my neck, your blissed leetle dove of a hand, and
fale how me heart goes pat for you. Sir Crayduck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
me duty to you, but you might ‘ave knowed how
to git out of the way, and lave the ladies to the
ladies.”</p>

<p>Sir Cradock Nowell marched away, thinking
what a blessing it was that he had not had much to
do with women. Then he reproached himself for
the thought, as he remembered his darling Violet,
the mother of his children. But, before he had
brooded very long in the only room he liked to use
now, his study just off from the library, a gentle
knock came <i>to</i> the door&mdash;as Biddy always expressed
it&mdash;and Eoa, dressed in deepest mourning
(made at Lymington, from her own frock, while
she lay ill at the Crown), came up to him steadily,
and kissed him, and sat on a stool at his feet.</p>

<p>“Oh, uncle, I am so sorry,” she said, with her
glorious hair falling over his knees, and her deep
eyes looking up at him, “I am so sorry, Uncle
Cradock, that I vexed you so, just now.”</p>

<p>“You did not vex me, my pretty. I was only
vexed for you. Now, remember one thing, my
darling&mdash;for I shall love you as my own daughter&mdash;I
have been very harsh and stern where, perhaps,
I had no right to be so: if I am ever unkind
to you, my dear, if I ever say anything hard, only
say ‘Clayton Nowell’ to me, and I will forgive you
directly.”</p>

<p>“You mean I must forgive <i>you</i>, uncle. I suppose
thatʼs what you mean. If you are unkind to
me, what will you want to forgive me for? But
I couldnʼt do it. I couldnʼt say it, even if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
had done any harm. Please to remember that I
either love or I hate people. I know that I shall
love you. But you must not contradict me. I
never could endure it, and I never will.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Sir Cradock, laughing; “I will
try to remember that, my dear. Though, in that
respect, you differ but little from our English
young ladies.”</p>

<p>“If you please, Uncle Cradock, I must go to&ndash;night
to see where you have put my father.
There, I wonʼt cry any more, because he told me
never to vex you, and I see that my crying vexes
you. Did you cry, yourself, Uncle Cradock, when
you heard of it first?”</p>

<p>She looked at him, as she asked this question,
with such wild intensity, as if her entire opinion of
him would hang upon his reply, that the old man
felt himself almost compelled to tell “a corker.”</p>

<p>“Well, my dear, I am not ashamed to confess&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ashamed to confess, indeed! I should rather
hope not. But you ought to be ashamed, I know,
if you hadnʼt cried, Uncle Crad. But now I shall
love you very much, now I know you did cry.
And how much have you got a year, Uncle
Crad?”</p>

<p>“How much what, my dear? What beautiful
eyes you have, Eoa; finer than any of the
Nowells!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. But that wonʼt do, Uncle Crad;
you donʼt want to answer my question. What I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
want to know is a very simple thing. How much
money have you got a year? You must have got
a good deal. I know, because everybody says so,
and because this is such a great place, as big as the
palaces in Calcutta.”</p>

<p>“Really, Eoa, it is not usual for young people,
especially young ladies, to ask such very point&ndash;blank
questions.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I did not know that, and I canʼt see any
harm in it. I know the English girls at Calcutta
used to think of nothing else. But I am not a bit
like them; it isnʼt that I care for the money a
quarter so much as tamarinds; but I have a particular
reason; and Iʼll find out in spite of you.
Just you see if I donʼt, now.”</p>

<p>“A very particular reason, Eoa, for inquiring
into my income! Why, what reason can you
have?”</p>

<p>“Is it usual for old people, especially old gentlemen,
to ask such very point&ndash;blank questions?”</p>

<p>Sir Cradock would have been very angry with
any other person in the world for such a piece of
impertinence; but Eoa gave such a smile of
triumph at having caught him in his own net (as
she thought), and looked so exquisite in her
beauty, as she rose, and the firelight flashed on
her; then she tossed her black hair over her
shoulders, and gave him such a kiss (with all the
spices of India in it) that the old man was at her
mercy quite, and she could do exactly what she
liked with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh, Mrs. Nowell Corklemore&mdash;so proud of
having obtained at last an invitation to Nowelhurst,
so confident that, once let in, you can
wedge out all before you, like Alexanderʼs phalanx&mdash;call
a halt, and shape your wiles, and look
to belt and buckler, have every lance fresh set and
burnished, every sword like a razor; for verily the
fight is hard, when art does battle with nature.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="p2">Previous to the matters chronicled in the preceding
chapter, Mr. Garnet had received a note,
of which the following is a copy:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;My friend, Major Blazeater, late of the
Hon. East India Companyʼs 59th Regiment of
Native Infantry, has kindly consented to see you,
on my behalf, to request a reference to any gentleman
whom you may be pleased to name, for the
purpose of concerting measures for affording me
that satisfaction which, as a man and a gentleman,
I am entitled to expect for your cowardly and
most ruffianly violence on the 28th ultimo.</p>

<p>“I beg you to accept my sincere apologies for
the delay which has occurred, and my assurance
that it has been the result of circumstances entirely
beyond my own control.</p>

<p class="pbq4">“I have the honour to be, Sir,</p>
<p class="pbq8">“Your most obedient Servant,</p>
<p class="pr4">“<span class="smcap">Rufus Hutton</span>.</p>

<p class="small">“Geopharmacy Lodge, Nov. 1st, 1859.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The circumstances beyond the fiery little doctorʼs
control were that he could not find any one who
would undertake to carry his message.</p>

<p>When Bull Garnet read this letter&mdash;handed to
him, with three great bows of the Chinese pattern,
by the pompous Major Blazeater&mdash;his face flushed
to a deep amethyst tinge, which subsided to the
colour of cork. Then he rolled his great eyes, and
placed one strong finger across the deep channels
of his forehead, and said, “Let me think, sir!”</p>

<p>“Hurrah,” said the Major to himself, “now we
shall have something to redeem the honour of the
age. It is a disgrace for a fellow to live in a country
where he can never get satisfaction, although he
gets plenty of insult.”</p>

<p>“Major Blazeater, you will make allowances for
me,” resumed Mr. Garnet; “but I have never
had much opportunity of becoming acquainted with
the laws&mdash;the code, perhaps, I should say&mdash;which
govern the honourable practice of duelling at the
present day.”</p>

<p>“No matter, my dear sir; no matter at all, I
assure you. Your second, when I have the honour
of meeting him, will settle all those little points,
which are beside the general issue; we shall settle
them together, sir, with the strictest regard to
punctilio, and to your entire satisfaction.”</p>

<p>“Capital fellow!” pursued the Major, in his own
reflection&ndash;room; “knew he couldnʼt be a coward:
just look at his forehead. No doubt he was perfectly
justified in kicking out Rue Hutton; Rue is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
such an impudent beggar. Ah! referring to his
pocket&ndash;book to find his military friendʼs address;
now we shall do it in style. Glorious fellow this
Garnet&mdash;shall have the very best powder. Wish I
was on his side.” And the Major rubbed his long
brown hands upon his lanky knees.</p>

<p>“Will it be according to rule,” asked Mr. Garnet,
looking steadily (“What an eye for a pistol!”
said the Major to himself), “quite according to
rule and order, if I write down for you, Major
Blazeater, the name of the friend to whom I refer;
also the time and place at which he will be ready
to discuss this little matter with you?”</p>

<p>“To be sure, to be sure, my dear sir; nothing
could be better. Your conduct, Mr. Garnet, does
you the very highest honour.”</p>

<p>“Nothing, you think, can be objected to my
course in this?&mdash;nothing against the high chivalric
code of modern duelling?”</p>

<p>“No, my dear sir, nothing at all. Please to
hand me the assignation; ha, ha, it is so pleasant&mdash;I
mean the rendezvous.”</p>

<p>Mr. Garnet handed to him a card, whereon was
written: “Town Hall, Lymington, Wednesday,
November 2nd. Before Admiral Reale, Col. Fale,
and C. Durant, Esq. Application will be made at
12 oʼclock for a warrant against Rufus Hutton and
Major Blazeater&mdash;Christian name unknown&mdash;for
conspiring together to procure one Bull Garnet to
fight a duel, against the peace of Her Majesty, and
the spirit of the age<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>Major Blazeater fell back in his chair; and all
his blood ran to his head. As he told his daughter
afterwards, he had never had such a turn in his
life. The fairest prospect blasted, the sunrise of
murder quenched; what good was it to live in a
world where people wonʼt shoot one another? Bull
Garnet bent his large eyes upon him, and the
Major could not answer them.</p>

<p>“Now, Major Blazeater,” said Mr. Garnet, “I
shall bind you over to keep the peace, and your
principal as well, and expose you to the ridicule of
every sensible man in England, unless I receive
by to morrow morningʼs post at 10.15 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> an
apology for this piece of infantile bravado. What
a man does in hot passion, God knows, and God
will forgive him for, if he truly strive to amend it&mdash;at
least&mdash;at least, I hope so.”</p>

<p>Here Mr. Garnet turned away, and looked out
of the window, and perhaps it was the view of Bob
that made his eyes so glistening.</p>

<p>“But, sir,” he resumed&mdash;while the Major was
wondering where on earth he should find any
sureties for keeping Her Majestyʼs peace, which he
could not keep with his wife&mdash;“sir, I look at things
of this sort from a point of view diametrically
opposed to yours. Perhaps you have the breadth
to admit that my view <i>may</i> be right, and yours
<i>may</i> be wrong.”</p>

<p>“Nothing, nothing at all, sir, will I admit to a
man who actually appoints the magistrates the
custodians of his honour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Honour, sir, as we now regard it, is nothing
more than foolʼs varnish. Justice, sir, and truth are
things we can feel and decide about. Honour is
the feminine of them, and, therefore, apt to confuse
a man. Major Blazeater, the only honour I have
is to wish you good morning.”</p>

<p>“Hang it all,” said the Major to himself, as he
was shown out honourably, “I have put my foot in
it this time; and wonʼt Mrs. Blazeater give it to
me! That woman finds out everything. This is
now the third time Iʼve tried to get up a snug
little meeting, and the fates are all against me.
Dash it, now, if Iʼve got to pay costs, O Boadicea
Blazeater, you wonʼt mend my gloves for a fortnight.”</p>

<p>Major Blazeater wore very tight doeskin gloves,
and was always wearing them out. Hence, his
appeal to the female Penates took this constricted
form. The household god of the Ph&oelig;nicians, and
the one whose image they affixed to the bows of
their galleys, hoping to steer homewards, was (as
we know from many sources) nothing but a lamb;
a very rude figure, certainly,&mdash;square, thick&ndash;set,
inelegant; but I doubt not that some grand home&ndash;truth
clung to their Agna Dea. Major Blazeater
was a lamb, whose wits only went to the shearing
the moment you got him upon his own hearth, and
Boadicea bleated at him. He would crumple his
neck up, and draw back his head, and look pleadingly
at any one, as a house&ndash;lamb does on Good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Friday, and feel that his father had done it before
him, and he, too, must suffer for sheepishness.</p>

<p>Meditating sadly thus, he heard a great voice
coming after him down the gravel&ndash;walk, and, turning
round, was once more under Mr. Garnetʼs eyes.
“One more word with you, if you please, sir. It
will be necessary that you two warlike gentlemen
should appoint a legal second. Mine will be Mr.
Brockwood, who will be prepared to show that
your principal was grossly inquisitive and impertinent,
before I removed him from my premises.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried the Major, delighted to find any
loophole for escape, “that puts a new aspect upon
the matter, if he gave you provocation, sir.”</p>

<p>“He gave me as strong provocation as one man
can well give another, by prying into my&mdash;domestic
affairs, in the presence of my son and daughter, and
even tampering with my servants. He left me
no other course, except to remove him from my
house.”</p>

<p>“Which you did rather summarily. My dear
sir, I should have done the same. Had I been
aware of these facts, I would have declined to bear
his cartel. You shall receive my apology by to&ndash;morrow
morningʼs post. I trust this unwise proceeding&mdash;may&mdash;may
not proceed any further.
Your behaviour, sir, does you credit, and requires
no vindication at law.”</p>

<p>Thus spoke Major Blazeater, bowing and smiling
elaborately under a combination of terrors&mdash;the law,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
public ridicule, expenses; worst of all, Mrs. Blazeater.
The next morning, Mr. Garnet received from
him a letter, not only apologetic, but highly eulogistic,
at which Bull Garnet smiled grimly, as he
tossed it into the fire. By the same post came a
letter from Rufus, to the following effect:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I regret to find that your courage consists
in mere brute force and power. I regard you
as no longer worthy of the notice of a gentleman.
The cowardly advantage you took of your superior
animal strength, and your still more cowardly
refusal to redress the brutal outrage, as is the
manner of gentlemen, stamp you as no more than
a navvy, of low mechanical brutishness. Do not
think that, because I cannot meet you physically,
and you will not meet me fairly, you are beyond
my reach. I will have you yet, Bull Garnet; and
I know how to do it. Your last ferocious outrage
has set me thinking, and I see things which I must
have been blind not to see before. I shall see you,
some day, in the felonʼs dock, an object of scorn to
the lowest of the low, so sure as my name is</p>

<p class="pr4">“<span class="smcap">Rufus Hutton</span>.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“P.S.&mdash;I shall be at Lymington to&ndash;morrow,
ready to meet you, if you dare initiate the
inquiry.”</p>

<p class="p1">Mr. Garnet did not burn this letter, but twice
read it through very carefully, and then stowed it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
away securely. Who could tell but it might be
useful as a proof of animus? During these several
operations his eyes had not much of triumph in
them.</p>

<p>Rufus Hutton rode to Lymington, carrying a
life&ndash;preserver: he appeared in the Town Hall, at
the petty sessions; but there was no charge made
against him. Being a pugnacious little fellow, and
no lover of a peaceful issue, he had a great mind
then to apply for a warrant against Garnet for
assaulting him. But he felt that he had given
some provocation, and could not at present justify
it; and he had in the background larger measures,
which might be foiled by precipitancy. So that
lively broil, being unfought out and unforgiven&mdash;at
least on one side&mdash;passed into as rank a feud as
ever the sun went down upon. Not that Mr.
Garnet felt much bitterness about it; only he
knew that he must guard against a powerful
enemy.</p>

<p>Amy had told her father, long ago, what Cradock
had said to her in the churchyard, and how
she had replied to him. In fact, she could not keep
it to herself until she went to bed that night; but
mingled her bright, flowing hair with his grey
locks, while her heart was still pit&ndash;a&ndash;patting, and
leaned on his shoulder for comfort, and didnʼt cry
much before she got it. “My own dearest, life of
my life,” cried John, forgetting both Greek and
Latin, but remembering how he loved her mother,
“my own and only child&mdash;now you do look so like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
your mother, darling&mdash;may the God who has made
you my blessing bless your dear heart in this!”</p>

<p>The very next day John Rosedew fell into a pit
of meditation. He forgot all about Pelethronian
Lapiths, the trimming of Gruterʼs lamp (which had
long engaged him; for he knew the flame of learning
there unsnuffed by any Smelfungus): even
the Sabellian elements were but as <i>sabellicus sus</i> to
him. It was one of his peculiarities, that he never
became so deeply abstracted as when he had to take
in hand any practical question. He could take in
hand any glorious thesis, such as the traces still
existing of a middle voice in Latin, or the indications
of very early civilization in Eub&oelig;a, and the
question whether the Ionians came not mainly westward&mdash;any
of these things he could think of, dwell
upon, and eat his dinner without knowing salt from
mustard. But he could not make a treatise of
Amy, nor could he get at her etymology. He
began to think that his education had been neglected
in some points. And then he thought about Socrates,
and his symposiastic drolleries, and most
philosophic reply when impeached of Xanthippic
weakness.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he could not make up his mind
upon one point&mdash;whether or not it was his duty to
go and inform Sir Cradock Nowell of his sonʼs
attachment. If the ancient friend had been as of
old, or had only changed towards John Rosedew,
continuing true all the while to the son, the parson
would have felt no doubt as to how his duty lay.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
And the more straightforward and honest course
was ever the first to open upon him. But, when
he remembered how sadly bitter the father already
was to the son, how he had even dared in his wrath
to charge him with wilful fratricide, how he had
wandered far and wide from the sanity of affection,
and was, indeed, no longer worthy to be called a
father, John Rosedew felt himself absolved from
all parental communion.</p>

<p>Then how was it as to expediency? Why, just
at present, this knowledge would be the very thing
to set Sir Cradock yet more against the outcast.
For, in the days of old confidence and friendly
interfusion, he had often expressed to John his
hope that Clayton might love Amy; and now he
would at once conclude that Cradock had been
throughout the rival of his darling, and perhaps an
unsuccessful one, till the other was got rid of.
Therefore John Rosedew resolved, at last, to hold
his peace in the matter; to which conclusion Aunt
Doxyʼs advice and Amyʼs entreaties contributed.
But these two ladies, although unanimous in their
rapid conclusion, based it upon premises as different
as could be.</p>

<p>“Inform him, indeed!” cried Miss Eudoxia,
swelling grandly, and twitching her shawl upon the
slope of her shoulders, of which, by&ndash;the&ndash;by, she was
very proud&mdash;she had heard it showed high breeding&mdash;“inform
him, brother John; as if his son had
disgraced him by meditating an alliance with the
great&ndash;granddaughter of the Earl of Driddledrum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
and Dromore! Upon such occasions, as I have
always understood, though perhaps I know nothing
about it, and you understand it better, John, it is
the gentlemanʼs place to secure the acquiescence of
his family. Acquiescence, indeed! What has our
family ever thought of a baronetcy? There is
better blood in Amy Rosedew, Brian OʼLynn, and
Cadwallader, than any Cradock Nowell ever had,
or ever will have, unless it is her son. Inform
him, indeed! as if our Amy was nobody!”</p>

<p>“Pa, donʼt speak of it,” said Amy, “until dear
Cradock wishes it. We have no right to add to
his dreadfully bad luck; and he is the proper
judge. He is sure to do what is right. And,
after all that he has been through, oh, donʼt treat
him like a baby, father.”</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p class="p2">Mrs. Nowell Corklemore by this time was
well established at the Hall, and did not mean in
her kind rich heart to quit the place prematurely.
Almost every day, however, she made some feint
of departure, which rendered every one more alive
to the value of her presence.</p>

<p>“How could her dear Nowell exist without her?
She felt quite sure he would come that day&mdash;yes,
that very day&mdash;to fetch her, in their little simple
carriage, that did shake her poor back so dreadfully”&mdash;back
thrown into prominence here, being
an uncommonly pretty one&mdash;“but oh, how thankful
she ought to be for having a carriage at all,
and so many poor things&mdash;quite as good, quite as
refined, and delicate&mdash;could scarcely afford a perambulator!
But she hoped for dear Sir Cradockʼs
sake, and that sweet simple&ndash;minded Eoa&mdash;who
really did require some little cultivation&mdash;that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
now she understood them both, and could do her
little of ministering, Mr. Corklemore would let her
stay, if it were only two days longer. And then
her Flore, her sweet little Flore! An angel of
light among them.”</p>

<p>Georgie had been married twice; and she was
just the sort of woman who would have been married
a dozen times, if a dozen, save one, of husbands
were so unfortunate as to leave her. Her
first lord, or rather vassal, had been the Count de
Vance&mdash;“a beggarly upstart Frenchman,” in the
language of his successor, who, by&ndash;the&ndash;by, had
never seen, but heard of him too often; but,
according to better authority, “a man one could
truly look up to; so warm&ndash;hearted, so agreeable;
and never for a moment tired, dear, of his poor
little simple wife.”</p>

<p>Perhaps it is needless to state that Mr. Corklemore
long had been so scientifically henpecked that
he loved the operation. Only he was half afraid
to say “Haw,” when his wife was there to cry
“Pshaw.”</p>

<p>Sir Cradock Nowell, of course, had seen a good
deal of what is called the world; but his knowledge
of women was only enough to teach him the extent
of that subject. He never was surprised much at
anything they did; but he could not pretend to
tell the reason of their doing it, even when they
had any, of which he did not often suspect them.
He believed that they would have their way, whenever
they could, wherever, and by whatever means;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
that very few of them meant what they said, and
none of them knew what they meant; that the
primal elements, in the entire body feminine, were
jealousy, impulsiveness, vanity, and contrariety.</p>

<p>Georgie Corklemore soon found out that he had
adopted this, the popular male opinion; and she
did not once attempt to remove it, knowing, as she
did, that nothing could be more favourable to her
purposes. So she took up the part&mdash;which suited
her as well as any, and enabled her to say many
things which else would have given offence&mdash;the
part of the soft, impulsive, warm&ndash;hearted, foolish
woman, who is apt among men to become a great
pet, if she happens to be good&ndash;looking.</p>

<p>Eoa would gladly have yielded her prerogatives
to Georgie, but Mrs. Corklemore was too wide
awake to accept any one of them. “No, darling,”
she replied, “for your own sake I will not. It is
true that Uncle Cradock wishes it, and so, no doubt,
do you; but you are bound to acquire all this
social knowledge of which you have now so little;
and how can you do so except by instruction and
practice?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” cried Eoa, firing up, “if Uncle Cradock
wishes it, I am sure Iʼll leave it to you, and not be
laughed at any longer. Iʼll go to him at once, and
tell him so. And, as for being bound, I <i>wonʼt</i> be
bound to learn any nonsense I donʼt like. My
papa was as wise as any of you, and a great deal
better; and he never made such a fuss about
rubbish as you do here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Stop, sweet child, stop a moment&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I am not a sweet child, and I wonʼt stop. And
another thing Iʼll tell you. I had made up my
mind to it before this, mind&mdash;before you tried to
turn me out of my place&mdash;and itʼs this. You may
call me what you like, but I donʼt mean to call you
‘Cousin Georgie’ any longer. In the first place, I
donʼt like you, and never shall as long as I live;
for I never half believe you: and, in the next
place, you are no cousin of mine; and social usage
(or whatever it is you are always bothering me
about) may require me to tell some stories, but not
that one, I should fancy. Or, at any rate, I wonʼt
do it.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” replied Mrs. Corklemore, looking
up from the softest of fancy&ndash;work, with the very
sweetest of smiles; “then I shall be obliged, in
self&ndash;defence, to address you as ‘Miss Nowell.’”</p>

<p>“To be sure. Why shouldnʼt you?”</p>

<p>“Well, it can be shown, perhaps, that you are
entitled to the name. Only at first it will seem
absurd when applied to a baby like you.”</p>

<p>“A baby like me, indeed!” This was Eoaʼs
sore point; and Georgie, who delighted in making
her outrageous, was always harping upon it. “Mrs.
Corklemore, how dare you call me, at my age, a
baby?”</p>

<p>Eoa looked down at Georgie, with great eyes
flashing fire, and her clear, bright forehead wrinkling,
and her light form poised like an antelopeʼs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
on the edge of a cliff. Mrs. Corklemore, not
thinking it worth while to look up at her, carelessly
threw back a curl, and went on with her rug&ndash;work.</p>

<p>“Because you are a baby, and nothing more,
Eoa.”</p>

<p>In a moment she was tossed through the air, and
sitting on Eoaʼs head, low satin chair and all. She
had not time to shriek, so rapid was her elation.
Little Flore, running in at the moment, clapped
her hands and shouted, “Oh, ma, have a yide, a
nice yide, same as me have yesterday. Me next,
me next. Oh, ah!”</p>

<p>Eoa, with the greatest ease, her figure as straight
as a poplar&ndash;tree, bore the curule chair and its occupant
to the end of the room, and there deposited
them carefully on a semi&ndash;grand piano.</p>

<p>“Thatʼs how we nurse the babies in India,” she
cried, with a smile of sweet temper, “but it takes
a big baby to do it, and some practice, I can tell
you. Now, Iʼll not let you down, Mrs. Corklemore,&mdash;and
if visitors come in, what will they
think of our social usages? Down you donʼt come,
till you have promised solemnly never to call me a
baby again.”</p>

<p>“My dear,” began Georgie, trying hard not to
look ridiculous&mdash;though the position was so unfavourable&mdash;“my
dear child&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, not my dear child, even! <i>Miss Nowell</i>,
if you please, and nothing else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Miss Nowell, if you will only lift me down&mdash;oh,
it is polished so nastily, I am slipping off already&mdash;I
will promise solemnly to call you only
what you like, all the rest of my life.”</p>

<p>Eoa lifted her off in an instant. “But mind, I
will be even with you,” cried Georgie, through her
terror, when safe on the floor once more.</p>

<p>“I donʼt care <i>that</i> for you,” answered Eoa, snapping
her fingers like a copper&ndash;cap; “only I will
have proper respect shown to me by people I particularly
dislike. People I love may call me what,
or do with me what, they please. My father was
just the same; and I donʼt want to be any better
than he was; and I donʼt believe God wants it.”</p>

<p>“He must be easily contented, then.”</p>

<p>Georgie, with all her deliciousness, could never
pass a chance of sarcasm.</p>

<p>“Now Iʼll go and have it out with Uncle Cradock,
about having you for my ayah.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Corklemore trembled far more at those
words than at finding herself on the piano. This
strange girl&mdash;whom she had so despised&mdash;was
baffling all her tactics, and with no other sword
and shield but those of truth and candour.</p>

<p>“Iʼve been a fool,” said Georgie to herself, for
about the first time in her life; “I have strangely
underrated this girl, and shall have hard work
now to get round her. But it must be done.
Come, though I have been so rash, I have two to
one in my favour, now I see the way to handle it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
But she must not tell the old noodle; that will
never do.”</p>

<p>“I thought, Miss Nowell,” she continued aloud,
“that it would not be considered honourable, even
among East Indians, to repeat to a third person
what was said familiarly and in confidence.”</p>

<p>“Of course not. What makes you speak of
it? Do you mean to say I would do such a
thing?”</p>

<p>“No, I am sure you would not, knowingly.
But if you think for a moment, you will see that
what I said just now, especially as to Sir Cradockʼs
opinions, was told to you in pure confidence, and
meant to go no further.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” answered Eoa, “then please not to tell
me anything in pure confidence again, because I
canʼt keep secrets, and you have no right to load
me with them, without ever asking my leave even.
But Iʼll try not to let it out, unless you provoke
me before him.”</p>

<p>With this half promise Georgie was obliged to
be content. She knew well enough that, if Eoa
brought the question before her uncle, the truth
would come out that Sir Cradock had never
dreamed for a moment of substituting Georgie,
the daughter of his cousin, for Eoa, the only
daughter of his only brother Clayton. He knew,
of course, that the Eastern maiden had no artificial
polish; but he saw that she had an inborn
truth, a delicacy of feeling, and a native sympathy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
which wanted only experience to be better
than any polish.</p>

<p>From that day forth, Mrs. Corklemore (aided
perhaps by physical terror) formed a higher
estimate of Eoaʼs powers. So she changed her
tactics altogether, and employed her daughter,
that sharp little Flore, to cover the next advance.
Flore was a little beauty; so far as anything
artificial can be really beautiful. Dressed, as she
was, in the height of French fashion, and herself
nine&ndash;tenths of a Frenchwoman&mdash;for there is no
such thing as a French <i>girl</i>, as we Englishmen
understand girlhood&mdash;she always looked like a
butterfly, just born in and just about to pop out
of a bower; for little Flore was “divinely beautiful.”</p>

<p>This angel was now nearly four years old,
and would look at you with the loveliest eyes that
ever appealed from the cradle to heaven, and
throw her exaggerated little figure back, and tell
you the biggest lie that an angel ever wiped her
mouth over. Oh, you lovely child! I would
rather have Loo Jupp, who knows a number of
bad words, which you would faint to hear of.
But Loo wonʼt tell a lie. Her father beat her out
of it the very first time she tried.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="p2">“Dear Uncle Cradock,” said Georgie next day,
for she had obtained permission long ago to address
her fatherʼs cousin so, “what a very sweet
girl our Eoa is!”</p>

<p>“I am very glad that you think so, Georgie;
she reminds me very often of what my brother
was at her age.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I do love her so. She has so much
variety, and she does seem so straightforward.”</p>

<p>“Not only seems but is so, Georgie; at times,
indeed, a little too much of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I doubt if there can be too much of it,”
cried Georgie, in the rapture of her own heartʼs
truth and simplicity, “especially among relations,
uncle. Just see now how all the misunderstandings
which arose between ourselves, for instance, might
have been saved by a little straightforward explanation.
In my opinion, our Eoa would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
absolutely perfect, if we could only put a little
polish, a little finish, upon her. I suppose that
was what her poor father intended, in bringing
her to England.”</p>

<p>“Ah, perhaps it was. I never thought of that.
But I have thought, often enough, my dear
Georgie, of my own duty towards her; and I
wish to consult you about it; you are so discreet
and sensible.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Mrs. Corklemore, with a facetious
curtsey, “to be sure I am, a perfect Queen
of Sheba.”</p>

<p>As this implied, by the manner of it, that Sir
Cradock was a perfect Solomon, he accepted the
chaff very graciously, and said to himself, “What
magnificent eyes my niece Georgie has, and what
a sweet complexion, and a most exquisite figure!
I wonder what Corklemore is about, in leaving her
here so long! But then he has such confidence
in her. Women of sense and liveliness, who have
an answer for everybody, are so much more trustworthy
than the sly things who drop their eyes,
and think all sorts of evil.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Georgie saw all this passing through
his mind&mdash;more clearly, perhaps, than she would
have seen it, if it had been passing through her
own.</p>

<p>“To be sure. How thoughtful of you! You
mean your duty, Uncle Cradock, as to making her
your heiress, now?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Corklemore knew well enough that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
meant nothing of the sort; but the opportunity
for the suggestion was too fine to be lost.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Sir Cradock, with a grim smile,
“you consider that my duty, do you? No, it was
not on that subject I was anxious for your opinion,
but as to sending the child to school, or taking
some other means to finish her education.”</p>

<p>“She wonʼt go,” replied Mrs. Corklemore, seeing
some chance of a quarrel here; “of course it
would be the best thing for her; but I am quite
certain the sweet creature never will go.”</p>

<p>“The sweet creature must, if I make her.”</p>

<p>“To be sure, Uncle Cradock; but I donʼt believe
you can. Has she not favoured you with
her intentions as to settling in life, rather&mdash;well,
perhaps rather prematurely?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the old man, laughing, “she has
informed me, with all due ceremony, of her intention
to marry Bob Garnet, the moment she is out
of mourning for her dearest father.”</p>

<p>“Master Garnet has not asked her yet. And I
have reason to believe”&mdash;&mdash; here Georgie softly
hesitated.</p>

<p>“What?” asked Sir Cradock, anxiously, for he
was very fond of Eoa; she was such a novelty to
him.</p>

<p>“That Master Bob Garnet, just come from
school, loves Amy Rosedew above Eoa, toffee,
rock, or peppermint.”</p>

<p>“Amy Rosedew is a minx,” answered the old man,
hotly. “I offered to shake hands with her, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
I met her on Wednesday, and was even going to
kiss her, because she is my god&ndash;daughter, and&mdash;and&mdash;an
uncommonly pretty girl, you know, and
what do you think she said?”</p>

<p>“Oh donʼt tell me, Uncle Cradock, if it was
anything impudent. You know I could not stand
it, thinking what I do of those Rosedews.”</p>

<p>“She threw herself back with her great eyes
flashing, and the colour in her cheeks dark crimson,
and she said, ‘No, thank you. No contact
for me with unnatural injustice!’ And she drew
her frock around her, and swept away as if the
road was not wide enough for both of us. Nice
behaviour, was not it? And I fear her father
endorses it.”</p>

<p>“I know he does,” answered Georgie, whose
face during that description had been a perfect
study of horror contending with humour; “I
know that Mr. Rosedew, one of the best men in
the world, if, indeed, he is sincere&mdash;which others
may doubt, but not I&mdash;he, poor man, having little
perception, except of his own interest, has taken a
most unfavourable view of everything we do here.
Oh, I am so sorry. It almost makes one feel as if
we must be in the wrong.” Beautiful Georgie
sighed heavily, like a fair woman at a confessional.</p>

<p>“His own interest, Georgie! Ourselves in the
wrong! I donʼt quite understand you.”</p>

<p>“As if we were harsh, you know, Uncle Cradock;
when, Heaven be thanked, we have not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>concluded, as too, too many&mdash;&mdash; But, not to talk
of that absurdity, and not to pain you, darling
uncle, you must know what I meant about Mr.
Rosedewʼs interest.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, I donʼt, Georgie. I donʼt see how
John&mdash;I mean Mr. Rosedewʼs interest is at all involved
in the matter.”</p>

<p>“He had a daughter passing fair,” sang Mrs.
Corklemore, without thinking. “Oh, uncle, I
forgot; I am so light&ndash;headed and foolish, I forget
everything now. It is Nowellʼs fault for worrying
me, as he does every week, about income.”</p>

<p>She passed her hand across her forehead, and
swept the soft dark hair back, as if worldly matters
were too many for her poor childish brain. Who
could look at her without wishing that she really
cared for herself, just a little?</p>

<p>“I insist upon knowing what you mean,
Georgie,” said Sir Cradock, frowning heavily, for
he was not at all sentimental; “John Rosedewʼs
daughter is Amy; and Amy, I know, is perfectly
honest, though as obstinate as the devʼ&mdash;hem, I
beg your pardon; I mean that Amy is very obstinate,
as well as exceedingly bigoted, and I might
almost say insolent.”</p>

<p>“Oh no; I can never believe that, Uncle Cradock,
even upon your authority.” In the heat of
truth, Mrs. Corklemore stood up and faced Sir
Cradock.</p>

<p>“But I tell you she is, Georgie. Donʼt try to
defend her. No young woman of eighteen ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
to have spoken as she did to me when I met her
last Wednesday. ‘Outrageous’ is the mildest
word I can use to describe her manner.”</p>

<p>“Very likely you thought so, dearest Uncle
Cradock; and so very likely I might have thought,
or any of the old&ndash;school people. But we must
make allowances&mdash;you know we are bound to do
so&mdash;for young people brought up to look at things
from a different point of view.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;by&mdash;George I wonʼt. I have heard that
stuff too often. Spirit of the age, and all that
balderdash. Because a set of young jackanapes
are blessed with impudence enough to throw to
the dogs all the teachings of ages, just when it
doesnʼt suit them, is it likely that we, who are old
enough to see the beauty of what they despise,
are to venerate and bow down to infantile inspiration,
which itself bows down to nothing? Georgie,
you are too soft, too mild. Your forbearance
quite provokes me. Leave me, if you please, to
form my own opinions, especially about people
whom I know so much better than you do.”</p>

<p>“I am sure, Uncle Cradock,” answered Georgie,
pouting, “I never presume in any way to interfere
with your opinions. Your judgment is proverbial;
whereas I have none whatever. Only it
was natural that I should wish you to think well
of one who is likely to be so nearly related to you.
What! why you look surprised, uncle? Ah, you
think me wrong in alluding to it. What a simple
silly I am, to be sure! But please not to be angry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
uncle. I never dreamed that you wished it kept
secret, dear, when all the parish is talking of it.”</p>

<p>“Georgie Corklemore, have the goodness to tell
me what you mean.”</p>

<p>“Oh, donʼt look at me so, uncle. I never could
bear a cross look. I mean no mystery whatever,
only Amy Rosedewʼs engagement to your unlucky&mdash;I
mean your unhappy son. Of course it has
your sanction.”</p>

<p>“Amy engaged to my&mdash;to that crafty Cradock!
I cannot believe it. I will not believe it; and at a
time like this!”</p>

<p>“Well, I thought the time ill&ndash;chosen. But I
am no judge of propriety. And they say that the
poor&mdash;poor darling who is gone, was himself
attached&mdash;let us hope that it was not so; however,
I cannot believe, Uncle Cradock, that you have
not even been told of it.”</p>

<p>“But I tell you, Georgie, that it is so. Perhaps
you disbelieve me in your anxiety to screen
them?”</p>

<p>“You know better than that, dear uncle. I
believe <i>you</i>, before all the world. And I will
screen them no longer, for I think it bad and
ungrateful of them. And after all you have done
for them! Why, surely, you gave them the living!
It makes me feel quite ill. Ingratitude always
does.” Georgie pressed her hand to her heart,
and was obliged to get up and walk about. Presently
she came back again, with great tears in her
eyes, and her face full of anger and pity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, uncle dear, I cannot tell you how grieved
I am for your sake. It does seem so hard&ndash;hearted
of them. How I feel my own helplessness that I
cannot comfort you! What a passion my Nowell
will be in, when I tell him this! His nature is so
warm and generous, so upright and confiding,
and he looks up to you with such devotion, and
such deep respect. I must not tell him at night,
poor fellow, or he would not sleep a wink. And
the most contumelious thing of all: that pompous
old maid, Miss Eudoxia Rosedew, to be going
about and boasting of it&mdash;the title and the property&mdash;before
any one had the manners even to inform so
kind a friend, and so affectionate a father! The
title and the property! How I hate such worldliness.
I never could understand how people could
scheme and plot for such things. And to make so
little of you, uncle, because they relied upon the
entail!”</p>

<p>This was quite a shot in the dark, for she knew
not whether any entail subsisted; and, as it was a
most essential point to discover this, Georgie fixed
her swimming eyes&mdash;swimming with love and
sympathy&mdash;full upon poor Sir Cradockʼs. He started
a little, but she scarcely knew what to augur
thence. She must have another shot at it; but
not on the present occasion.</p>

<p>It is scarcely needful, perhaps, to say, knowing
Mrs. Corklemore and Miss Rosedew as we do, that
there was not a syllable of truth in what the former
said of the latter. Sir Cradock himself would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
doubted it, if he had been any judge of women;
for Miss Eudoxia Rosedew thought very little of
baronets. How could she help it, she of the illustrious
grandmother? Oh her indignation, if she
only could have dreamed of being charged with
making vaunt over such a title! Neither was it
like her, even if she had thought great things of
any pledged alliance, to go about and share her
sentiments with the “common people.” The truth
of the matter was this: Georgie, with her natural
craft&mdash;no, no! skill I mean; how a clumsy pen
will stumble&mdash;and ten more years of life to drill it,
had elicited Amyʼs sentiments; as one who, having
stropped a razor, carves his ladyʼs pincushion, or
one who blowing on bright gimlet tempts the spigot
of bonded wine, or varlet who with a knowing
worm giveth taste of Stilton. Or even,</p>

<p class="phq p1">“As when a man, a sluice&ndash;captain, adown from a backwater headspring,</p>
<p class="phn">All through his plants and garden a waterflow is pioneering,</p>
<p class="phn">Holding a shovel in hand, from the carrier casting the sods out;</p>
<p class="phn">Then as it goes flowing forward, the pebbles below in a bevy</p>
<p class="phn">Swirl about, and it rapidly wimpling down paterooneth,</p>
<p class="phn">In a spot where a jump of the ground is, and overgets even the guideman.”</p>

<p class="pr4"><i>Il.</i> xxi. 257.</p>

<p class="p1">So sweet Amy, being under&ndash;drawn of her native
crystal by many a sly innuendo and many an
Artesian auger, gushed out, like liquid diamonds,
upon the skilful Georgie, and piled upon her a
flood of truth, a Scamander upon Achilles. Oh
water upon a duckʼs back, because Georgie always
swam in truth; please not to say that Castalia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
<i>rore puro</i>, wets not the kerchief of a lady thrice
dipped in Styx.</p>

<p>And so it came to pass that young Amy let out
everything, having a natural love of candour and
a natural hatred of Georgie, and expecting to
overwhelm her with the rolling seventh billow of
truth. Mrs. Corklemore, softly smiling, reared
her honest head out of the waters, sleeked her soft
luxuriant locks, and the only thing likely to overwhelm
her was sympathy unfathomable. Amy did
not wish for that, and begged her, very dryly, by
no means to exhaust herself; for Amy had moral
scent of a liar, even as her father had.</p>

<p>Now that father&mdash;the finest fellow, take him for
all in all, whom one need wish to look upon&mdash;was
(according to a good manʼs luck) in fearful tribulation.
Fearful, at least, to any man except John
Rosedew himself; but John, though fully alive to
the stigmotype of his position, allowed his epidermis
to quill toward the operator, and abstracted
all his too sensitive parts into a Sophistic apory.</p>

<p>John, sitting in his book&ndash;room, had got an apron
tucked well under his rosy chin&mdash;an apron with
two pockets in it, and the strings in a bow at the
back of his neck; and he trembled for his ear&ndash;lobes,
whenever he forgot his subject. Around
him, with perpetual clatter, snip and snap and stirabout,
hovered, like a Jewish maiden fingering the
mill&ndash;stone, who but his Eudoxia?</p>

<p>In her strong right hand was a pair of shears,
keen as those of Atropos, padded at the handles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
lest to hurt the thumb, but the blades, the trenchant
edges&mdash;oh what should keep their bright love
asunder? No human ear, for a moment; nay,
nor the nose of a mortal. Neither was this risk
and tug, and frequent fullersʼ&ndash;teaseling, the whole
or even the half of the agony John was undergoing.
For though he sat with a pile of books
heaped in fair disorder round him&mdash;though three
were pushing about on his lap, dusting themselves
on his well&ndash;worn kersey, like sparrows on a genial
highway&mdash;though one was even perched on his
right hand and another on his left, yet he had no
more fruition of them (save in the cud of memory)
than had Prometheus of his fire&ndash;glow in the frost
of Strobilus, or than the son of Jove and Pluto,
whom Ulysses saw, had of his dessert.</p>

<p class="phq p1">“Nay, then I looked at Tantalus having a rough tribulation,</p>
<p class="phn">Standing fast in a lake, and it came quite home to his chin&ndash;beard;</p>
<p class="phn">Nevertheless he stood thirsting, and had not to seize and to quaff it;</p>
<p class="phn">For every time when the old man would stoop in his longing to quaff it,</p>
<p class="phn">Then every time the water died, swallowed back, and at his ancles</p>
<p class="phn">Earth shone black in a moment, because a divinity parched it.</p>
<p class="phn">Trees as well, leafing loftily, over his head poured fruitage,</p>
<p class="phn">Pear&ndash;trees, and pomegranates, and apple&ndash;trees glittering&ndash;fruited,</p>
<p class="phn">Fig&ndash;trees of the luscious, and olive&ndash;trees of the luxuriant;</p>
<p class="phn">Whereat whenever the old man shot out his hands to grasp them,</p>
<p class="phn">Away the wind would toss them into the shadowy cloudland.”</p>

<p class="pr4"><i>Od.</i> xi. 581.</p>

<p class="p1">“Now, John, you are worse than ever, I do
declare you are; why, you wonʼt even hold your
neck straight. I try to make you look decent:
I try so <i>very hard</i>, John; and you havenʼt even
the gratitude to keep your chin up from the apron.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
You had much better go to a barber, and get half
your hair pulled out by the roots, and the other
half poisoned with a leaden comb, and then youʼll
appreciate <i>me</i>, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“We read,” said John Rosedew, complacently
gazing at his white locks as they tumbled and took
little jumps on the apron, “that when the Argives
lost Thyrea, they pledged themselves to a law and
a solemn imprecation, that none of the men should
encourage his hair, and none of the ladies wear
gold.”</p>

<p>“And pray what gold do <i>I</i> wear? Brother
John, you are so personal; you never can let me
alone. I do believe you have never forgiven me
my poor dear grandmotherʼs ring, and watch, and
Aunt Dianaʼs brooch and locket; no, nor even my
own dear motherʼs diamond ring with the sapphires
round it. And perhaps you donʼt hate even my
bracelet, a mere twist of gold with catʼs eyes! Oh,
John, John, how can you be my brother, and
show such a little mind, John?”</p>

<p>“Whence we may infer,” continued John,
quite unruffled; for he knew that it would be
worse than useless to assure Miss Doxy that he
was not even aware of the existence of the things
he was impeached with; “or at least we have some
grounds for supposing that the Greeks, a very
sensitive and highly perceptive race, did not like to
have their hair cut. Compare with this another
statement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, indeed I wonʼt, John. I should rather
hope I would not. You canʼt hold your tongue
for a moment, however solemn the occasion is.
There, thatʼs the third cut youʼve got, and I wonʼt
take another snip at you. But you have quoted
less Greek than usual; thatʼs one comfort, at any
rate, and I will put you on some gold&ndash;beaterʼs skin,
for being so very good, John. Only donʼt tell
Amy; she does make such a fuss about it. But
there, I need not tell you, for you wonʼt know how
you got them in half an hourʼs time. Now, donʼt
make a fuss, John; one would think you were
killed”&mdash;poor John had dared to put his hand up&mdash;“as
if you cared indeed even if you had three
great stripes of red all down your collar, or even
upon your white neckerchief. You wouldnʼt be at
all ashamed of yourself. Have you the face to say
that you would, now?”</p>

<p>“Well, dear Doxy, I am not convinced that you
are reasonable in expecting me to be ashamed of
bleeding when you have been cutting me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course not. I never <i>am</i> reasonable,
according to your ideas. But one thing you may
be convinced of, and that is, that I never will toil
and degrade myself by cutting your hair again,
John, after this outrageous conduct.”</p>

<p>John had been visited so often with this tremendous
menace, that he received it with no satisfaction.
Well he knew that on that day four
weeks he must don the blue apron again, unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
something happened worse even than Aunt Doxyʼs
tonsorial flourishes.</p>

<p>“Now, you are not done yet, John. You are
in a great hurry, are you not, to get the apron off
and scatter the hair all about? Whatʼs the good
of my taking the trouble to spread Jemimaʼs shawl
down? Can you imagine you are done, when I
havenʼt rubbed you up with the rosemary even?”</p>

<p>“ʼCoronari marino rore!’ No wonder good
Flaccus puts it after ‘multâ cæde bidentium.’ Oh,
Doxy, you are inexorable. O averse Penates!
By the way, that stanza is to my mind the most
obscure (with one exception) in all the Odes.
Either Horace had too much of the ‘lene tormentumʼ
applied just then ‘ingenio non sæpe duro,’
or else&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Please, miss”&mdash;all the girls called her miss&mdash;“Dr.
Hutton, miss!”</p>

<p>Bang went Miss Doxy, quicker than thought,
left an exclamation, semi&ndash;profane, far behind on
the light air, slammed the door on the poor girlʼs
chilblains, bolted and locked it, and pulled out
the key, and put the scutcheon over the keyhole.</p>

<p>“Well, why, <i>διὰ τί</i>; <i>πόθεν</i>; unde terrarum?
Women are not allowed to say ‘mehercle,’ neither
men ‘mecastor;’ ‘ædepol’ is common to both, but
only ‘inscitiâ antiquitatis;’ for the most ancient
men abstained from that even, and I dare say were
none the worse for it&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I have no patience with you, John,” cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Miss Doxy, snatching up brush, comb, scissors, extract
of the sea&ndash;dew, the blue apron, Jemimaʼs
shawl of grey hair, and we know not how many
other things, and huddling all into a cupboard, and
longing to lock herself in with them.</p>

<p>“Great truths come out,” answered John, quite
placidly, “at periods of mental commotion. But
why, oh Doxy, and whence this inopine hurry&ndash;scurry?
There is no classic expression&mdash;except
perhaps in Aristophanes&mdash;of prosody quick enough;
and, doubtless, for very good reason, because
the people were too wise to hurry so. ‘Rumpe
moras,’ for instance, is rather suggestive of&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, John! oh, John! even at such a moment,
John! I believe youʼll die in Latin or Greek&mdash;and
I donʼt know which Amen is, only I donʼt believe
itʼs English&mdash;there, I am as bad as you are to
discuss such a question now. And I am quite
sure Jenny canʼt tell a good story soundly. And
he has got such ferret eyes! Thank Heaven, the
key was inside, John.”</p>

<p>Poor Miss Doxy was panting so, that her brother
was quite frightened for her; and the more so
because he had no idea what there was to be
frightened at.</p>

<p>“Why, Doxy,” he said, “my darling, he need
never see that you have cut me.”</p>

<p>“As if I cared for that! Oh, John, my dearest
brother, heʼll see <i>that Iʼve cut your hair</i>!”</p>

<p>The idea struck John Rosedew as so gloriously
novel&mdash;that man who knew the world so!&mdash;to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
it appeared such a mountain of wonder that a sister
should want to sink through the floor, for having
saved her brother from barberism, that he laughed
as hard as any man of real humour ever laughs.
Miss Doxy stole on the opportunity, when he sat
down to have his laugh out, to dust all the white
hair with her handkerchief from his coat&ndash;collar.</p>

<p>Suddenly John Rosedew got up, and his laugh
went away in gravity. He walked to the door
more heavily than was natural to him (lest he
should seem to go falsely), unlocked and unbolted
it, and in his most stately manner marched into the
hall. Jenny was telling a “jolly lie”&mdash;jollity down
below, I suppose&mdash;to Mr. Rufus Hutton; she was
doing it very clumsily, not “oculo irretorto.”</p>

<p>“Please, sir, yes, my master is gone round the
parish, sir; and the rest, they be at the school, sir.
How sorry they will be, to be sure, to hear that you
have called, sir, and all of them out of the way so!”</p>

<p>“No, they wonʼt,” said Mr. Rosedew, looking
over her head; “the only thing I am sorry for,
Jenny, is that you can tell a falsehood so. But
the fault is not yours only. I will talk to you by&ndash;and&ndash;by.
Dr. Hutton, come in, if you please. I
was having my hair cut by my sister, Miss Rosedew.
You have met her before. Eudoxia, Dr.
Hutton is kind enough to come and see us. I have
told him how good and how sisterly you have
been to me, and I am sure that he must wish to
have a sister so capable&mdash;that is to say if he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
not,” added John, who was very particular about
his modal and temporal prefix.</p>

<p>Miss Rosedew came forward, with a few white
hairs still on her dark “reps” bell&ndash;sleeve, and, being
put upon her mettle, was worthy of her brother.
Oh dear, that such a grand expression should be
needful, even over the shell of the roasted egg of
snobbery! Rufus Hutton, of course, not being
quite a fool, respected, and trusted, and loved them
both, more than he would have done after fifty
formal dinners. And he knew quite well that there
was on his own part something akin to intrusion;
for he had called in the forenoon, when visits
from none but an intimate friend are expected;
and he had pushed his advance rather vigorously,
not towards the drawing&ndash;room, but to Johnʼs favourite
book&ndash;room, where the lady Licinus plied
her calling. But for this he had good reason, as
he wished to see Mr. Rosedew alone, and the
cause of his visit was urgent.</p>

<p>It was not long before the lady, feeling rather
unhappy because she was not arrayed much better
than the lilies of the field are, withdrew in a very
noble manner, earning gratitude of Rufus. Then
the doctor drew his chair close home to the parsonʼs,
looked all round the room, and coughed to try how
big the echo was. Finding no response returned
by that prolific goddess, who loves not calf or
sheep&ndash;skin, and seeing that no other lady was dangerously
acoustic, Rufus inclined his little red head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
towards Johnʼs great and black and slightly
liparous waistcoat, and spake these winged words:</p>

<p>“Ever see a thing like that, sir?”</p>

<p>“No, I donʼt think I ever did. Dear me, how
odd it smells! Why, how grave you are, Dr.
Hutton!”</p>

<p>“So will you be, when I have told you what I
have to tell. My discovery is for your ears only;
I have been to London about it, and there found
out its meaning. Now I will act upon your advice.
Nothing in all my experience&mdash;though I have seen
a great deal of the world&mdash;nothing has ever surprised
me more than what I have told you.”</p>

<p>“But you forget, Dr. Hutton,” cried John, imbibing
excitement, “that as yet you have told me
nothing at all, only shown me something which I
cannot in the least make out. A cylinder, hollow,
and blocked at one end; of a substance resembling
book&ndash;binding, and of a most unsavoury odour!”</p>

<p>“Ha!” replied Rue Hutton, “ha, my dear sir,
you little guess the importance of that thing no
bigger than a good cigar. Ah, indeed! Ah, yes!”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me, or not, Dr. Hutton?
Your behaviour is most unusual. I am greatly surprised
by your manner.”</p>

<p>“Ah, no doubt; no doubt of that. Very odd if
you were not. I also am astonished at your apparent
indifference.”</p>

<p>Hereupon Rufus looked so intensely knowing,
so loaded with marvel and mystery, too big to be
discharged even, that John Rosedew himself, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
calm and large, and worthy to be called a philosopher,
very nearly grew wroth with longing to
know what all the matter was.</p>

<p>Then Dr. Hutton, having bound him by a solemn
promise that he would not for the present even
hint of that matter to any one, poured out the
hissing contents of his mind under the white curls
which still overhung the elder manʼs porch of
memory. And what he told him was indeed a
thing not to be forgotten.</p>

<p>The spectator is said to see more of the game
than any of the players see, and the reader of a
story knows a great deal more than the actors
do, or the writer either, for that matter; marry,
therefore, I will not insult any candid intelligence,
neither betray Rue Huttonʼs faith, for he
is an awkward enemy.</p>

<p>The very next day there came a letter, with coal
enough on it to make some gas, and directed in a
wandering manner to “Rev. Mr. Rosedew, Nowelhouse,
somewhere in England.” Much as we abuse
the Post&ndash;office people, they generally manage to
find us out more cleverly than we do them; and
so this letter had not been to more than six wrong
places. As our good journalists love to say, “it
was couched in the following terms:”&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p class="p2">Cradock Nowell had written from London
to the Parsonage once, and once only. He told
them how he had changed his name, because his
father had cast him off; and (as he bitterly added),
according to filial promise, he felt himself bound
to be Nowell no longer. But he did not say what
name he had taken, neither did he give any address;
only he would write again when he had found some
good situation. Of course he longed to hear from
Amy&mdash;his own loving Amy, who begged that poor
letter and bore it in her own pure bosom long after
the Queenʼs head came off&mdash;but his young pride
still lay hot upon him, and for Amyʼs sake he
nursed it.</p>

<p>A young man is never so proud of his honour,
so prompt to deny himself anything, so strong in
anotherʼs lifehold, and careless about his own living,
as when he has won a true loveʼs worth, and sees it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
abiding for ever. Few are the good who have such
luck&mdash;for the success is not of merit, any more
than it is in other things; more often indeed some
fish&ndash;tailed coxcomb is a womanʼs Dagon, doubly
worshipped for crushing her&mdash;but when that luck
does fall to the lot of a simple and honest young
fellow, he piles his triple mountains up to the everlasting
heaven, but makes no Babel of them. A
man who chatters about his love soon exhausts
himself or his subject.</p>

<p>John Rosedew, after receiving that letter, shut
every book on his table, chairs, and desk, and
chimney&ndash;piece. He must think what to do, and
how: and he never could think hard on the flints
of daily life, while the green pastures of the dead
were tempting his wayward steps away. Of course
he would go to London at once, by the very next
train; but whether or no should he tell his people
the reason of his going? He felt so strongly
inclined to tell, even at risk of domestic hysterics
and parochial convulsions, that he resolved at last
not to tell; for he thought of the great philosopherʼs
maxim (not perhaps irrefragable), that when the
right hangs dubious, we may safely conclude that
it rides in the scale swinging opposite to our own
wishes. To most of us (not having a quarter of
John Rosedewʼs ability, and therefore likely to be
a hundred times less hesitant) it seems that the
maxim holds good with ourselves, or any other
common mortal, but makes Truth actually cut her
own throat when applied to a mind like his&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
mind already too timorously and humorously self&ndash;conscious.</p>

<p>Let 99,000 angels get on the top of John Rosedewʼs
pen&mdash;which generally had a great hair in it&mdash;and
dance a <i>faux pas</i> over that question, if it was
laid the wrong way; for we, whose consciences
must work in corduroys and highlows, roughly conclude
that right and wrong are but as button and
button&ndash;hole when it comes to a question of hair&ndash;splitting.
Blest are they whose conscience&ndash;edge,
like the sword of Thor, can halve every wisp of
wool afloat upon the brook of life.</p>

<p>After breakfast John mounted Coræbus, leaving
a short farewell, and set off hastily with the old&ndash;fashioned
valise behind the saddle, wherein he was
wont to bear wine and confections upon his parochial
tours. The high&ndash;mettled steed was again
amazed at the pace that could be pumped out
of him; neither did he long continue ingloriously
mute, but woke the echoes of Ytene with many a
noble roar and shriek, so that consternation shook
the heart of deer and pig and cow. But the
parson did not exult as usual in these proofs of
velocity, because his soul within him was sad;
nevertheless he preserved cohesion, or at least
coincidence, in an admirable manner, with his feet
thrust strenuously into the stirrups, his bridle&ndash;hand
thrown in great emergencies upon the peak of the
saddle, and whip&ndash;hand reposing on the leathern
outwork, which guarded and burnished his rear.
Anchored thus by both strong arms&mdash;for the sake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
of his mission and family&mdash;he felt capable of
jumping a gate, if Coræbus had equal confidence.</p>

<p>That evening he entered the Ducksacre shop,
and found no one there but the mistress.</p>

<p>“Pray excuse me, but I have been told, maʼam,”
said John Rosedew, lifting his hat&mdash;as he always
did to a matron&mdash;and bowing his silvery head,
“that you have a lodger here who is very ill.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Mrs. Ducksacre, fetching her
breath very quickly, “and dead, too, for all I
know. Oh Lord, I am so put upon!”</p>

<p>The soft&ndash;hearted parson was shocked at this
apparent apathy; and thought her no true woman.
Who is not wrong sometimes? It was a very rare
thing for John Rosedew to judge man or woman
harshly. But only half an hour ago that poor
woman had been up&ndash;stairs, neglecting till, present
and future, estranging some excellent customers,
leaving a wanton shop&ndash;boy to play marbles with
Spanish chestnuts, while she did her most misguided
best to administer to sick Cradock soup wildly
beyond her own economy, and furiously beyond
his powers of deglutition.</p>

<p>John Rosedew, with his stout legs shaking, and
his stockings expressing excitement, went up three
pairs (ill&ndash;assorted) of stairs into Cradockʼs sick
room. Then he started back from the Aristophanic
climax&mdash;even the rags of Telephus;
though after all, Polly Ducksacre had done her
best to make the room comely. Why, there were
three potato&ndash;sacks on the bed, with the names of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
Fulham growers done in red letters upon them,
and giving the room quite a bright appearance, as
if newly&ndash;marked sheep were in it. Nay, and I
could almost swear there were two bast mats from
Covent Garden, gloriously fixed as bed curtains,
mats from that noble market where a rat prays
heaven vainly to grant him the coat of a water&ndash;rat.</p>

<p>There, by Cradock Nowellʼs bed, sat the faithful
untiring nurse, the woman who had absorbed such
a quantity of strap, and had so kindly assimilated
it. Meek&ndash;spirited Rachel Jupp waited and watched
by the bed of him through whom she had been
enfranchised. Since Issachar Jupp became a
Christian she had not tasted the buckle&ndash;end once,
and scarcely twice the tongue&ndash;end.</p>

<p>She had been employed some years ago as a
nurse in the Middlesex Hospital; so she knew her
duties thoroughly. But here she had exceeding
small chance of practising that knowledge; because
scarcely anything which she wanted, and would
have rung for, if there had been any bell, was ever
to be found in the house. Even hot water, which
the doctor had ordered, was cold again ere it came
to her, and had taken an hour before it started;
for there was no fireplace in the little room, nor
even on the floor below it.</p>

<p>Uncle John could scarcely keep from crying, as
he looked at poor Craddy propped up in the bed
there, with his lips so pale and bloodless, cheeks
sunken in and shining like dry oyster&ndash;shells, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
with a round red spot in the centre, large eyes
glaringly bright and starting, and red hot temples
and shorn head swathed with dripping bandages;
while now and then he raised his weak hands
towards the surging tumult, and dropped them
helpless on the sun&ndash;blind, tucked round him as
part of his counterpane.</p>

<p>“Ah, thatʼs the way, sir,” said Rachel, after she
had risen and curtseyed, “thatʼs the way he go on
now, all the day and all the night; and he have
left off talking now altogether, only to moan and to
wamble. He used to jump up in the bed at first,
and shut his left eye, and put his arms like this, as
if he was shooting at something; and it pleased him
so when I give him the hair&ndash;broom. He would
put the flat of it to his shoulder, and smile as if he
see some game, and shoot at the door fifty times a
day; and then scream and fall back and cover his
eyes up. But he havenʼt done that these three days
now; too weak, Iʼm afeard, too weak for it.”</p>

<p>John Rosedew sighed heavily for the bright
young mind, so tried above what it was able to bear;
then, as he kissed the flaming forehead&mdash;sometimes
flaming and sometimes icy&mdash;he thought that it
might be the Fatherʼs mercy to obliterate sense of
the evil. For the mind of the insane, or at least
its precious part, is with Him, who showers afar
both pain and pleasure, but keeps at home the
happiness.</p>

<p>“Can you send for the doctor at once, maʼam, or
tell me where to find him?” The parson still kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
to the ancient fashion, and addressed every woman
past thirty as “maʼam,” whatever her rank or condition.
As he spoke, a heavy man entered on
tiptoe, and quietly moved them aside. A raw&ndash;boned,
hulking fellow he was, with a slouch and a
squint, made more impressive by a black eye in the
third and most picturesque stage, when mauve, and
lilac, and orange intone and soften sweetly off from
the purple nucleus outward; as a boyʼs taw is, or
used to be, shaded, with keen artistic feeling, in
many a ring concentric, from the equator to the
poles. Mr. Juppʼs face was a villainous one; as
even the softest philanthropist would have been
forced to acknowledge. The enormous jaws, the
narrow forehead, the grisly, porkish eyebrows, the
high cheek&ndash;bones, and the cunning skance gleam
from the black, deep&ndash;ambushed squinters&mdash;all these
were enough to warn any man who wished to get
good out of Zakey Jupp that he must try to put it
there first, and give it time to go to the devil and
back, as we say that parsley&ndash;seed does.</p>

<p>Mr. Jupp was a man of remarkable strength,&mdash;not
active elastic Achillean vigour, nor even stalwart
Ajacian bulk, but the sort of strength which
sometimes vanquishes both of those, by outlasting,&mdash;a
slouching, slow&ndash;to&ndash;come, long&ndash;to&ndash;go heft, that
had scarcely found its proper wind when better&ndash;built
men were exhausted.</p>

<p>Men of this stamp are usually long&ndash;armed, big
in the lungs and shoulders, small in the loins,
knock&ndash;kneed, and splay&ndash;footed; in a word, shaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
like a John Dory, or a millerʼs thumb, or a banjo.
They are not very “strong on their pins,” nor
active; they generally get thrown in the first bout
of wrestling before ever their muscles get warm;
they cannot even run fast, and in jumping they
spring from the heel; nevertheless, unless they
are stricken quite senseless at the outset&mdash;and
their heads for the most part are a deal too thick
for that&mdash;the chances are that they make an
example of the antagonist ere he is done with.
And so, in Mr. Juppʼs recent duello with an Irish
bully, who scoffed at Cradock, and said something
low of his illness, the Englishman got the worst of
it in the first round, the second, the third, and the
fourth; but, just as Dan Sullivanʼs pals and
backers were wild with delight and screeching, the
brave bargee settled down on his marrow, and the
real business began. After twenty&ndash;five rounds,
the Tipperary Slasher had three men to carry him
home, and looked fit for an inquest to sit upon,
without making him any flatter.</p>

<p>Now, Issachar being a very slow man, there
was no chance that he would hurry over his present
inspection of Cradock. For a very long time he
looked at him from various points of view; then,
at last, he shook his head, and poked his long black
chin out.</p>

<p>“Now this here wunna do, ye know. Iʼll fetch
the doctor to ye, master, as ye seem to care for the
pore young charp.”</p>

<p>And Zakey Jupp, requiring no answer, went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
slowly down the stairs, with a great hand on either
wall to save noise; then at a long trot, rolling over
all who came in his way, and rounding the corners,
like a ship whose rudder&ndash;bands are broken, he followed
the doctor from street to street, keeping up
the same pace till he found him. Dr. Tink was
coming out of a court not far from Marylebone&ndash;lane,
where the small&ndash;pox always lay festering.</p>

<p>“Yeʼll just corm street ‘long wi’ me to the poor
charp as saved our Looey,” said Mr. Jupp, coolly
getting into the brougham, and sitting in the place
of honour, while he dragged Dr. Tink in by the
collar, and set him upon the front seat. “Fire
awa’ now for Martimer&ndash;straat,” he yelled to the
wondering coachman, “and if ye dunna laither the
narg, mind, Iʼll laither ye when we gits there.”</p>

<p>The nag was leathered to Mr. Juppʼs satisfaction,
and far beyond his own, and they arrived at the
coal and cabbage shop before John Rosedew had
finished reading a paper which Mrs. Jupp had
shown him, thinking that it was a prescription.</p>

<p>“He wrote it in his sleep, sir, without knowing
a thing about it; in his sleep, or in his brain&ndash;wandering;
I came in and found him at it, in the
middle of the night; and my, how cold his fingers
was, and his head so hot! We took it to three
great chemists’ shops, but they could not make it
up. They hadnʼt got all the drugs, they said, and
they couldnʼt make out the quantities.”</p>

<p>“Neither can I,” said John; “but it rings well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
considering that the poor boy wrote it when his
brain was weak with fever. The dialects are
somewhat muddled, moreover; but we must not be
hypercritical.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, to be sure not. I am sure I meant no
hypocrisy. Only you see it ainʼt Christian writing;
and Mr. Clinkers shake his head at it, and say it
come straight from the devil, and his hoof in every
line of it.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Jupp, the Greek characters are beautiful,
though some of the lines are not up to the mark.
But, for my part, I wonder how any man can
write mixed Greek in London. Nevertheless, I
shall have great pleasure in talking it over with
him, please God that he ever gets well. To think
that his poor weary brain should still be hankering
after his classics!”</p>

<p>It was the dirge in Cymbeline put into Greek
choral metre, and John Rosedewʼs tears flowed
over the words, as Polydoreʼs had done, and
Cadwalʼs.</p>

<p>Unhappy Cradock! His misty brain had vapoured
off in that sweet wild dirge, which hovers
above, as if the freed soul lingered, for the clogged
one to shake its wings to it.</p>

<p>The parson was pondering and closing his wet
eyes to recover his faith in God&mdash;whom best we
see with the eyes shut, except when His stars are
shining&mdash;while Issachar Jupp came up the stairs,
poking Dr. Tink before him, because he still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
thought it likely that the son of medicine would
evaporate. The doctor, who knew his tricks and
put up with them, lest anything worse might come
of it, solaced his sense of dignity, when he got to
the top, by a grand bow to Mr. Rosedew. John
gave him the change in a kind one; then offered
his hand, as he always did, being a man of the
ancient fashion.</p>

<p>While they were both looking sadly at Cradock,
he sat up suddenly in the bed, and stretching forth
his naked arms (wherein was little nourishment),
laughed as an aged man does, and then nodded at
them solemnly. His glazed eyes were so prominent,
that their whites reflected the tint of the
rings around them.</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen, stop him if you please,
and give him a pen and ink, and my best hat to
write on. Oh, donʼt let him go by.”</p>

<p>“Stop whom, my dear sir?” asked the doctor,
putting out his arms as if to do it. “Now Iʼve
stopped him. Whatʼs his name?”</p>

<p>“The golden lad. Oh, donʼt you know? You
canʼt have got him, if you donʼt. The golden lad
that came from heaven to tell me I did not do it,
that I didnʼt do it, do it, sir&mdash;all a mistake altogether.
It makes me laugh, I declare it does; it
makes me laugh for an hour, every time he comes,
because they were all so wise. All but my Amy,
my Amy; she was such a foolish little thing, she
never would hear a word of it. And now I call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
you all to witness, obtestor, antestor, one, two,
three, four, five; let him put it down on a sheet of
foolscap, with room enough for the names below
it; all the ladies and gentlemen put their names in
double column, and get Mr. Clinkers, if you can,
and Jenny, to go at the bottom; only be particular
about the double column, ladies one side, gentlemen
the other, like a country dance, you know, or the
‘carmen sæculare,’ and at the bottom, right across,
Miss Amy Rosedewʼs name.”</p>

<p>The contemplation of that last beatitude was too
much for the poor fellow; he fell back, faint on
the pillow, and the shop&ndash;blind, untucked by his
blissful emotions, rattled its rings on the floor.</p>

<p>“Blow me if I can stand it,” cried Issachar
Jupp, going down three stairs at a step; and when
he came back his face looked clearer, and he
said something about a noggin. Mrs. Ducksacre
bolted after him, for business must be attended to.</p>

<p>“Will he ever be right again, poor fellow? Dr.
Tink, I implore you to tell me your opinion
sincerely.”</p>

<p>“Then I cannot say that <i>I think</i> he will. Still,
I have some hopes of it. Much will depend upon
the original strength of the cerebellum, and the
regularity of his previous habits. If he has led a
wild, loose life, he has no chance whatever of
sanity.”</p>

<p>“No, he has led a most healthy life&mdash;temperate,
gentle, and equable. His brain has always been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
clear and vigorous, without being too creative.
He was one of the soundest scholars for his age I
have ever met with.”</p>

<p>“But he had some terrible blow, eh?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, a most terrible blow.”</p>

<p>John thought what a terrible blow it would be
to his own lifeʼs life, if the issue went against him,
and for tears he could ask no more.</p>

church were agreeably surprised, on the following
Sunday, by the announcement from Mr. Pell&mdash;in
that loud sonorous voice of his, which had frightened
spinsters out of their wits, lest he were forbidding,
instead of asking their banns of matrimony&mdash;that
there would be no sermon that
morning, inasmuch as he, the Rev. Octavius, was
forced to hurry away, at full speed, to assuage the
rampant desire of Rushford for the performance
of divine service.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nowell Corklemore, who had the great
curtained pew of the Hall entirely to herself and
child&mdash;for Eoa never would go to church, because
they defy the devil there&mdash;Georgie, who appeased
her active mind by counting the brass&ndash;headed
nails, and then multiplying them into each other,
and subtracting the ones that were broken, lifted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
her indescribable eyes, and said, “Thank God,”
almost audibly.</p>

<p>Octavius Pell, hurrying out of the porch,
ascended Coræbus, as had been arranged; but he
did it so rapidly, and with such an air of decision,
that Amy, standing at the churchyard gate, full
of beautiful misgivings, could not help exclaiming,</p>

<p>“Oh please, Mr. Pell, whatever you do, leave
your stick here till Monday. We will take such
care of it.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, I fear I must not, Miss Rosedew,”
Octavius answered, gravely, looking first at his
stick, and then at the flanks of Ræby, who was
full of interesting tricks; “I have so far to go,
you know, and I must try to keep time with them.&mdash;Whoa,
you little villain!”</p>

<p>“Oh dear, I am so sorry. At any rate please
not to strike him, only <i>stroke</i> him with it. He is
so <i>very</i> high&ndash;spirited. And he has never had a
weal upon him, at least since he came to papa.
And I could not bear to see it. And I know you
wonʼt, Mr. Pell.”</p>

<p>Octavius looked at the soft&ndash;hearted girl, blushing
so in her new drawn bonnet&mdash;mauve with
black, for the sake of poor Clayton. He looked
at her out of his knowing dry eyes in that sort of
response&ndash;to&ndash;the&ndash;Litany style which a curate adopts
to his rectorʼs daughter.</p>

<p>“Can you suppose, Miss Rosedew, that I would
have the heart to beat him now?&mdash;Ah, you will,
will you then?” Ræbus thought better of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, I hope you would not,” said Amy, in
pure good faith, with a glance, however, at the
thick bamboo, “because it would be <i>so cruel</i>. It
is hollow, I hope; but it has such knots, and it
looks so very hard!”</p>

<p>“Hollow, and thin as a piece of pie&ndash;crust; and
you know how this wood splits.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so glad, because you canʼt hurt him
so very much. Please not to go, if you can hold
him, more than three miles and a half an hour.
Papa says that is the pace that always suits his
health best. And please to take the saddle off,
and keep it at your house, that the Rushford boy
may not ride him back. And please to choose a
steady boy from the head&ndash;class in your Sunday
school, and, if possible, a communicant. But Iʼm
sadly afraid thereʼs no trusting the boys.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, I fear not,” said Octavius, gravely;
and adding to himself, “at any rate when you are
concerned, you darling. What a love you are!
But thereʼs no chance for me, I know; and itʼs a
good job for me that I knew it. Oh you little
angel, I wonder who the lucky fellow is!” Aunt
Eudoxia had dropped him a hint, quite in a casual
way, when she saw that the stout young bachelor
was going in, over head and ears.</p>

<p>Sweet Amy watched Mr. Pell, or rather his
steed, with fond interest, until they turned the
corner; and certainly the pace, so far, was very
sedate indeed. Octavius was an upright man&mdash;you
could see that by his seat in the saddle&mdash;as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
well as a kind and good&ndash;natured one;
and on no account would he have vexed that
gentle and beautiful girl. Nevertheless he grew
impatient, as Coræbus pricked his ears pretentiously,
and snorted so as to defy the winds, and
was fain to travel sidewise, as if the distance was
not enough for him; and all the time he was
swallowing the earth at the rate of no more than
four miles an hour. Then the young parson
pulled out his watch, and saw that it wanted but
half an hour of the time himself had fixed for the
morning service at Rushford. And he could not
bear the thought of keeping the poor folk waiting
about the cross, as they always did and would
wait, till the parson appeared among them. As
Mr. Wise has well observed, “the peasant of the
New Forest is too full of veneration.”</p>

<p>And here let me acknowledge, as behoveth a
man to do, not in a scambling preface, which
nobody ever would read, but in the body of my
work, great and loving obligation to the labours of
Mr. John R. Wise. His book is perfectly beautiful,
written in admirable English, full of observation,
taste, and gentle learning; and the
descriptions of scenery are such that they make
the heart yearn to verify them. I know the New
Forest pretty well, from my own perambulations
and perequitations&mdash;one barbarism is no worse
than the other&mdash;but I never should have loved it
as I do but for his loving guidance.</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Pell, as some people put when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
write to a parson,&mdash;hoping still to keep faith with
Amy, because her eyes were so lovely,&mdash;pulled
the snaffle, and turned Coræbus into a short cut,
through beeches and hazels. Then compromise
came soon to an end, and the big bamboo was
compelled to fall upon the fat flank of Coræbus,
because he would not go without it. He showed
sense of that first attention only by a little buck&ndash;jump,
and a sprightly wag of his tail; then,
hoping that the situation need not be looked in the
face, shambled along at five miles an hour, with a
mild responsibility.</p>

<p>“Five miles more,” said Octave Pell, “and only
twenty minutes to do it in! Itʼs an unlucky thing
for you, Coræbus, that your mistress is engaged.”
Whack, came the yellow bamboo again, and this
time in solid earnest; Ræbus went off as if he
meant to go mad. He had never known such a
blow since the age wherein he belonged to the
innkeeper. Oh, could a horse with four feeds a
day be expected to put up with tyranny?</p>

<p>But, to the naggyʼs great amazement, Octave
Pell did not tumble off; more than that, he seemed
to stick closer, with a most unpleasant embrace,
and a pressure that told upon the wind&mdash;not of
heaven but of horse&mdash;till the following symptoms
appeared:&mdash;First a wheeze, and creak internal, a
slow creak, like leather chafing, or a pair of bellows
out of order; then a louder remonstrance,
like the ironwork of a roller, or the gudgeons of a
wheelbarrow; then, faster and faster, a sucking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
noise, like the bucket of an old pump, when the
gardener works by the job; finally, puff, and roar,
and shriek, with notes of passing sadness, like the
neap&ndash;tide wailing up a cavern, or the lament of
the Berkshire Blowing Stone.</p>

<p>In forest glades, where hollow hoofs fell on the
sod quite mutely, that roar was enough to try
masculine courage, though never unnerved by a
heart&ndash;shock. How then could poor Pearl Garnet,
sitting all alone, in a lonely spot, wherein she had
pledged herself to her dead love, sitting there to
indulge her tears, the only luxury left her&mdash;how
could she help being frightened to death as the
unearthly sound approached her?</p>

<p>The terror was mutual. Coræbus, turning the
corner sharply, stopped short, in a mode that must
have sent his true master over his withers, to explore
the nature of the evil. Then he shook all
through, and would have bolted, if the bamboo
had not fallen heavily.</p>

<p>In the niche of a hollow oak was crouching,
falling backward with terror, and clutching at the
brave old bark, yet trying to hide behind it&mdash;only
the snowy arms would come outwards&mdash;a beautiful
girl, clad in summer white on that foggy day of
December. The brown cloak, which had protected
her from sylvan curiosity, lay on the ground, a
few yards away, on the spot so sad and sacred.
Pearl Garnetʼs grief, if we knew the whole of it,
or perhaps because we cannot, was greater than
any girl could bear. A lovely, young, and loving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
maid, with stores of imagination, yet a practical
power of stowing it; of building castles, yet keeping
them all within compass of the kitchen&ndash;range;
quite different from our Amy, yet a better wife
for <i>some</i> men&mdash;according to what the trumps are,
and Amy must have hearts, or she dies;&mdash;that
very nice girl, we have let her go weep, and never
once cared to follow her. There is never any
justice in this world; therefore who cares to
apologise? It would take up all our business&ndash;time,
if we did it properly.</p>

<p>Now, as she stretched her white arms forth,
and her delicate form shrunk back into the black
embrace of the oak&ndash;tree; while her rich hair was
streaming all down her breast, and her dark eyes
still full of tear&ndash;drops; the rider no less than the
horse was amazed, and seemed to behold a vision.
Then as she shrunk away into the tree&ndash;bole, with
a shriek of deadly terror&mdash;for what love casteth out
fear?&mdash;and she saw not through the ivy&ndash;screen,
and Coræbus groaned sepulchrally, Pell came down
with a dash on one foot, and went, quick jump, to
help her.</p>

<p>In a fainting fit,&mdash;for the heart so firm and
defiant in days of happiness was fluxed now and
frail with misery&mdash;she was cowering away in the
dark tree&ndash;nook, like the pearls of mistletoe fallen,
with her head thrown back (such an elegant head,
a womanʼs greatest beauty), and the round arms
hanging helpless.</p>

<p>Hereupon Mr. Pell was abroad. He had never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
experienced any sisters, nor much mother consciously&mdash;being
the eighth son, as of course we
know, of a jolly Yorkshire baronet; at any rate
he had lost his mother at the birth of Nonus Pell;
and I am sorry there are not ninety of them, if of
equal merit.</p>

<p>So Octavius stood like a fish out of water, with
both hands in his pocket, as it is so generally the
habit of fishes to stand.</p>

<p>Then, meaning no especial harm, nor perhaps
great good, for that matter, he said to himself&mdash;</p>

<p>“Confound it all. What the deuce am I to
do?”</p>

<p>His sermon upon the Third Commandment,
about to be preached at Rushford, where the
fishermen swore like St. Peter,&mdash;that sermon went
crack in his pocket at such a shocking ejaculation.
Never heeding that, he went on to do what a
stout fellow and a gentleman must have done in
this emergency. He lifted the drooping figure
forth into the open air, touching it only with his
hands, timidly and reverently, as if every fair
curve were sacred. Then he fetched water in his
best Sunday hat&mdash;the only chimney&ndash;pot he possessed&mdash;from
the stream trickling through the
spire&ndash;bed; and he sprinkled it on the broad, white
forehead, as if he were christening a baby.</p>

<p>The moment he saw that her life was returning,
and her deep grey eyes, quiet havens of sorrow,
opened and asked where their owner was, and her
breast rose like a billow in a place where two tides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
meet, that moment Octave laid her back against
the rugged trunk, in the thick brown cloak which
he had fetched when he went for the water; and
wrapped it around her, delicately, as if she were
taking a nap there.</p>

<p>Oh, man of short pipes and hard, bachelor fare,
for this thou deservest as good a wife as ever
basted a leg of mutton!</p>

<p>At last the young lady looked up at him with a
deep&ndash;drawn sigh, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>“I am afraid I have been very silly.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, you have not. But I am very
sorry for you, because I am dreadfully clumsy.”</p>

<p>She glanced at his snowy choker&mdash;which he
never wore but on Sundays&mdash;and, being a very
quick&ndash;witted young woman, she guessed at once
who he was.</p>

<p>“Oh, please to tell me&mdash;I hope the service is
not over at Nowelhurst church.”</p>

<p>“The service has been over for a quarter of an
hour; because there was no sermon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what shall I do, then? What can I do?
I had better never go home again.”</p>

<p>This was said to herself in anguish, and Pell
saw that he was not meant to hear it.</p>

<p>“Can I go, please, to the Rectory? Mr. Rosedew
is from home; but Iʼm sure they will give me
shelter until my&mdash;until I am sent for. I have lost
my way in the wood here.”</p>

<p>This statement was none of the truest.</p>

<p>“To be sure,” said the hasty parson, forgetting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
about the Rushford bells, the rheumatic clerk, and
the quid&ndash;chewing pilots&mdash;let them turn their quids
a bit longer&mdash;“to be sure, I will take you there at
once. Allow me to introduce myself. How very
stupid of me! Octavius Pell, Mr. Rosedewʼs
curate at Rushford.”</p>

<p>Hereupon “Pello, pepuli, pulsum” (as his
friends loved to call him from his driving powers
at cricket, and to show that they knew some Latin)
executed a noble salaam&mdash;quite of the modern
school, however, and without the old reduplication
(like the load on the back of Christian)&mdash;till the
duckweed came out of his hat in a body, and fell
into the flounce tucket of the beautiful Pearlʼs
white skirt.</p>

<p>She never looked, though she knew it was there&mdash;that
girl understood her business&mdash;but curtseyed
to him prettily, having recovered strength by this
time; and there was something in his dry, manly
tone, curt modesty, and breeding, without any
flourish about it, which led the young maid to
trust him, as if she had known him since tops
and bottoms.</p>

<p>“I am Pearl Garnet,” said she, imitating his
style unconsciously, “the daughter&mdash;I mean I
live at Nowelhurst Dell Cottage.”</p>

<p>Coræbus had cut off for stable long ago, with
three long weals from bamboo upon him, which
he vowed he would show to Amy.</p>

<p>“Please to take my arm, Miss Garnet. You
are not very strong yet. I know your brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
well; and a braver or more straightforward young
gentleman never thought small things of himself
after doing great ones.”</p>

<p>Pearl was delighted to hear Bobʼs praises; and
Mr. Pell treated that subject so cleverly, from
every possible point of view, that she was quite
astonished when she saw the Rectory side&ndash;gate, and
Octavius, in the most light&ndash;hearted manner, made
a sudden and warm farewell, and darted away for
Rushford. How good it is for a sad, heavy heart
to exchange with a gay and light one!</p>

<p>“Hang it! after that let me have a burster!”
was his clerical ejaculation, “or else it is all up
with me. I hope we havenʼt spilt the sermon,
though, or got any duckweed down it. Duckweed,
indeed; what a duck she is! And oh,
what splendid eyes!”</p>

<p>He ran all the way to Rushford, at a pace unknown
to Coræbus; and his governor&ndash;coat flew
away behind him, with the sermon banging about,
and the text peeping out under the pocket&ndash;lap.
“Swear not at all,” were the words, I believe;
and a rare good sermon it must have been, if it
stuck to the text under the circumstances.</p>

<p>The jolly old tars, after waiting an hour, orally
refreshing their grandmothers’ epitaphs, and close&ndash;hauling
on many a tight yarn, were just setting up
stunʼsails to take grog on board at the “Luggerʼs
Locker,” hard by, as the banyan time was
over. Let them ship their grog, and their old
women might keep gravy hot, and be blessed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
them. They had come there for sarvice, and
shiver their timbers if theyʼd make sail till the
chaplain came. Good faith, and they got their
service at last, but an uncommonly short&ndash;winded
one, a sermon, moreover, which each man felt
coming admirably home&mdash;to his shipmate.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Pell had left behind no small
excitement at Nowelhurst. For a rumour took
wing after morning service&mdash;when the wings of
fame are briskest in all country parishes&mdash;that
parson John was gone to London to complain to
the Queen that Sir Cradock Nowell never came to
church now, nor even sent his agent thither, to
manage matters for him. For Mr. Garnet still
retained his stewardship among them, though
longing to be quit of it, and discharging his duties
silently, and not with his old pronouncement,
because his health was weaker. The vivid power
of vital force seemed to be failing the man who
had stamped his character upon all people around
him; because he never said a thing which he did
not think, and scarcely ever thought a thing with
any fear of saying it.</p>

<p>Hitherto we have had of Bull Garnet by far the
worse side uppermost. I will offer no excuses now
for his too ready indulgence of his far too savage
temper. In sooth, we meet with scarce any case
in which excuses are undiscoverable. God and
the angels find them always; our best earthly
friends can see them, when properly pointed out;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
our enemies, when they want to make accusation
of them.</p>

<p>All I will say for Bull Garnet is (to invert the
historianʼs sentence) “Hæc tanta viri vitia ingentes
virtutes exæquabant”&mdash;“These blemishes, however
dark, had grand qualities to redress them.” Strong
affection, great scorn of falsehood, tenderness
almost too womanly, liberality both of mind and
heart, a real depth of sympathy&mdash;would all these
co&ndash;exist with, or be lost in, one great vice? It
appears to me that we are so toothed in, spliced and
mortised, dovetailed, double&ndash;budded, and inarched,
both of good and evil, that the wrong, instead of
poisoning the right, often serves as guano to it.
Nevertheless we had better be perfect&mdash;when we
have found the way out.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p class="p2">It must not be forgotten that Rufus Hutton all
this time was very hard at work, and so was Mrs.
Corklemore. Between that lady and Eoa pleasant
little passes gave a zest to daily intercourse,
Georgieʼs boundless sympathies being circumscribed
only by terror. Nevertheless, although
Sir Cradock laughed (when his spirits were good,
and his mind was clear) at their fundamental
difference, Georgie began to gain upon him, and
Eoa to lose ground. How could it be otherwise,
even if their skill had been equal&mdash;and Eoa not
only had no skill, but scorned sweet Georgie for
having any&mdash;how could Mrs. Corklemore fail of
doing her blessed duty, when she was in the house
all day, and Eoa out, jumping the river, or looking
about for Bob Garnet? Whatever the weather
was, out went Eoa, peering around for the tracks
of Bob, which, like those of a mole, were self&ndash;evident;
and then hiding behind a great tree when she
found him; and hoping, with flutter of heart about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
it, that Bob had not happened to see her. Yet, if
he happened not to see, she would go up and be
cross with him, and ask whether Amy Rosedew
had turned to the right or left there, or had
stopped in a hollow tree. And did Bob think she
looked well that morning? Then he had no right
to think so. And perhaps her own new hat, with
black ostrich, was a hideously ugly thing. Oh, she
only wished there were tigers!</p>

<p>Leave the little dear to do exactly as she likes&mdash;for
nothing else she will do; and now, in looking
through the forest, grey and white with winter,
scorn we not the grand old trunk, in our gay love
of the mistletoe.</p>

<p>There is a very ancient tree, an oak well
known and good of fame, even at the first perambulation
of our legislator king. It stands upon the
bend and brow under which two valleys meet,
where a horse&ndash;shoe of the wood has chanced, and
water takes advantage. In the scoop below the
tree, two covered brooks fetch round high places
into one another, prattle satisfaction, and steal
away for their honeymoon, without a breeze upon
them. This “mark&ndash;oak,” last of seven stout
brothers, dwells upon a surge of upland, and commands
three valleys, two of which unite below it,
and the other leads them off, welcoming their
waters. The grand tree lifts its proven column,
channeled, ramped, and crocketed, flaked with
brown on lines of grey, and bulked with cloudlike
ganglions. Then from the maintop, where is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
room for fifty archers to draw the bow, limbs of
rugged might arise, spread flat, or straggle downwards.
But the two great limbs of all, the power
and main glory, the arms that reared their pride to
heaven, are stricken, riven, and blasted. Gaping
with great holes and rotten, heavily twisted in and
out, and ending in four long scraggy horns, ghastly
white in the winter sun; where the squirrel durst
not build, nor the honey&ndash;buzzard watch for prey;
this shattered hope of a noble life records the wrath
of Heaven.</p>

<p>The legend is that a turf&ndash;cutter having murdered
a waylost pedlar, for the sake of his pack, buried
the corpse in this hollow tree, and sat down on the
grave to count his booty. Here, while he was
bending over the gewgaws and the trinkets, which
he had taken for gold upon the poor hucksterʼs
word, and which gleamed and flashed in the
August twilight, the vengeance of God fell upon
him. In bodily form Godʼs lightning crashed
through the dome of oak above him, leaped on the
murdererʼs head, and drove him through the cloven
earth, breast to breast on his victimʼs corpse. You
may be sure that the sons of Ytene, a timid and
superstitious race, find small attractions in that
tree, when the shades of night are around it.</p>

<p>John Rosedew did not return on the Monday,
nor yet on the Tuesday, &amp;c. Not even until the
last down&ndash;train roared through the Forest on
Saturday. Then, as it rushed through the dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
night of winter, throwing its white breath (more
strong than our own, and very little more fleeting)
in bracelets on the brown&ndash;armed trees, and in
chains on the shoulders of heather, the parson
leaned back on the filthy panels of a second&ndash;class
carriage, and thought of the scene he had left.</p>

<p>He had written from London to Miss Rosedew,
insisting, so far as he ever cared to insist on a
little matter, that none at home should stay up for
him, that no one should come to the station to
meet him, and that Pell should be begged to hold
himself ready for the Sundayʼs duty, because Mr.
Rosedew would not go home, if any change should
that day befall unlucky Cradock Nowell. Lucky
Cradock, one ought to say, inasmuch as for a
fortnight now he had lost all sense of trouble.</p>

<p>Finding from Dr. Tink that no rapid change
was impending, John Rosedew determined to
see his home, and allay his childʼs anxiety.
Moreover, he felt that his “cure of souls” must
need their Sunday salting. Now walking away
from the wooded station that cloudy Christmas
Eve&mdash;for Christmas that year fell on Sunday&mdash;how
grand he found the difference from the dirty
coop of London.</p>

<p>The new moon was set, but the clouds began to
lift above the tree&ndash;tops, and a faint Aurora flushed
and flickered in the far north&ndash;west. Then out came
several stars rejoicing, singing in twinkles their
Makerʼs praise; and some of the sounds that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
breathe through a forest, even in the hush of a
winterʼs night, began to whisper peace and death.</p>

<p>John, who feared not his Masterʼs works, and
was happiest often in solitude, trudged along with
the leathern valise, and three paper parcels strapped
comfortably upon his ample back. Presently he
began to think of home and his parish cares, and
the breadth of God spread around him; and then
from thinking rose unawares into higher communion,
for surely it is a grander thing to feel
than to think of greatness.</p>

<p>And in this humour quietly he plodded his proper
course for the first four miles or so, until he had
passed the Dame Slough, near the Blackwater
stream, and was over against Vinney Ridge. But
here he must needs try a short cut, through the
Government Woods, to Nowelhurst, though even in
the broad daylight he could scarcely have found
his way there. He thought that, in spite of his
orders, Amy would be sure to stay up for him, and
so he must hurry homeward.</p>

<p>At a fine brisk pace, for a man of his years, he
plunged into the deep wood, and in five minutesʼ
time he had very little hope of getting out before
daylight. Have you ever been lost in a great wood
at night, alone, and laden, and weary, where the
frithings have not been cut for ten years, when
there is no moon or wind to guide a man, and the
stars glimpse so deceitfully? How the stubs, even
if you are so quick&ndash;footed as not to be doubled
back by them, or thrown down with nostrils patulous&mdash;how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
they catch you at the knee with three
prongs apiece, and make you think of white swelling!
Then the slip, where the wet has dribbled
from some officious branch, or sow, or cow, summer&ndash;pasturing,
has kept her volutabre. Down you
plump, and your heels alone have chance of going
to heaven, because (unless you are a wonder) you
employ such powerful language.</p>

<p>Rising with some difficulty, after doubting if it
be worth the while, and rubbing spitefully ever so
long at “the case of the part affected,” you have
nothing for it but to start again, and fall into worse
disasters. Going very carefully then you jump
from the goading repulse of a holly into the heart
of a hazel&ndash;bush&mdash;one which has numberless clefts
and tongs, and is hospitable to a bramble. Tumbling
out of it, full of thorns, recalling your Farnaby
epigram, and wishing they had pelted the hazel
harder, away you go, quite desperate now, knowing
well that the wood is full of swamps, some of which
will petrify you, under sun&ndash;dew and blue campanula,
when the summer comes again.</p>

<p>Through all these pleasing incidents and animating
encounters John Rosedew went ahead, and,
too often, a “header,” until he was desperately
tired, and sat down to think about it. Then he
heard two tawny owls hooting to one another,
across at least a mile of trees; and every forest
sound grew clearer in the stillness of the night;
the sharp, sad cry of the marten&ndash;cat, the bark of
the fox so impatient, the rustle of the dry leaves as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
a weasel or rat skirred over them, the wing&ndash;flap of
some sliding bird roused from his roost by danger,
the scratching of claws upon trunks now and then,
and the rubbing of horns against underwood: these
and other stranger noises, stirring the “down of
darkness,” moving the sense of lonesome mystery
and of fear indefinite, were abroad on the air (in
spite of Shakespeare) on that Christmas Eve.</p>

<p>John Rosedew laid his burden by, and began to
think, or wonder, what was best to do. Long as
he had lived amid the woods, he knew much more
of classic sylvulæ and poetical arundines, than
of the natural greenwood, and the tasseling of
morasses.</p>

<p>Bob Garnet would have found his way there, or
in any other English forest, with little hesitation.
From his knowledge of all the epiphytes and their
different aspects, the bent of the winter grasses,
the sense which even a bramble has of sun and
wind and rain, he would soon have established his
compass, with allowance for slope and exposure.</p>

<p>The parson sat upon an ants’ nest, which had
done its work, and feeling discharged, collapsed
with him&mdash;a big nest of the largest British ant,
which is mostly found near fir&ndash;trees. That nest alone
would have told poor Bob something of his whereabouts;
for there are not many firs in that part of
the forest, and only one clump, high up on a hill,
in the wood where John Rosedew had lost himself.
But the man of great learning was none the wiser,
only he felt that his smallclothes were done for,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
and Mr. Channingʼs fashionable cut gone almost
as prematurely as the critic who had condemned it.</p>

<p>“Let me now consider,” said Mr. Rosedew to
himself, for about the fiftieth time; “it strikes me
at the first sight&mdash;though I declare I canʼt see
anything&mdash;would that I could not feel! for I confess
that these legs are grievous; but putting aside
that view or purview of the question, it strikes me
that, having no Antigone to lead me from this,
which certainly is the grove of the Eumenides&mdash;there
is another ant gone up my leg&mdash;ʼingentis
formica laboris.’ I wish he wouldnʼt work so hard,
though, and I always have had the impression that
they stayed in&ndash;doors in the winter. Mem. To consult
Theophrastus, and compare him, as usual, with
Pliny. Also look at the Geoponika, full of valuable
hints&mdash;why there he is again, biting very hard
or stinging. What says Aristophanes about the
music of the gnats? Indelicate, I fear, as he too
often is. Nay, nay, good ant, if indeed thou art
an ant&mdash;&mdash; Why, what is that over yonder?”</p>

<p>It was a dim light in the great hollow oak, “the
Murdererʼs Tree,” as they called it, not a hundred
yards from John Rosedew.</p>

<p>The parson approached it cautiously, for he
knew that desperate men, and criminals under a
ban, still harboured sometimes in the Forest. As
he drew nearer, the feeble light, glimmering
through the entrance, showed him at once what
tree it was, because the rays glanced through two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
dark holes under the bulging and beetling brow,
which peasants call “the eyes of God.”</p>

<p>John Rosedew was as brave a man as ever
wept for anotherʼs grief, or with the word of God
assuaged it. No man could have less superstition,
unless (as some would have us believe) all religion
is that. Upon this point we will not be persuaded,
until we have seen them live the better,
and die the more calmly for holding it. Yet
John Rosedew, so firmly set, so full of faith in
his Maker, so far above childish fears (which
spring from the absence of our Father),&mdash;he, who
having injured none had no dread of any, yet
drew back and trembled greatly at the sight
before him.</p>

<p>A small reflector&ndash;lamp, with the wick overhung
with fungus, stood upon a knotted niche in the
hollow of the tree. By it, and with his face and
eyes set towards the earth, a tall and powerful
man, stripped to the waist, was leaning, with one
great arm beneath his forehead, and bloody stripes
across his back. The drooping of his figure, the
woe in every vein of it, the deep and everlasting
despair in every bone&mdash;it was an extremity of our
human nature, which neither chisel nor pen may
approach, nor even the mind of man conceive,
until it has been through it.</p>

<p>Presently the man upraised his massive head,
and scorned himself for being so effeminate. He
had nearly fainted with the pain; what right had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
he to feel it? Why should his paltry body quail
at a flea&ndash;bite lash or so, when body and soul were
damned for ever?</p>

<p>But if his form had told of sorrow, great God,
what did his face tell? He never sighed, nor
groaned, nor moaned; his woe was beyond such
trumpery; he simply took the heavy scourge from
the murdererʼs grave, upon which it had dropped
when the swoon came over him, and, standing
well forth in the black hollowʼs centre, to gain full
swing for his scorpion thongs, he lashed himself
over back and round breast, with the utmost
strength of his mighty arms, with every corded
muscle leaping, but not a sign of pain on his face,
nor a nerve of his body flinching. Then, at last,
he fell away, and allowed himself to moan a
little.</p>

<p>John Rosedew would have leaped forward at
once, in his horror at such self&ndash;cruelty, but that
he saw who it was, and knew how his meddling
would be taken. He knew that Bull Garnetʼs
religious views were very strange and peculiar,
and never must be meddled with, except at his
own request, and at seasonable moments. Yet he
had never dreamed that self&ndash;chastisement was part
of them.</p>

<p>“Garnet a wild flagellant!” said the parson to
himself; “well, I knew that he was an enthusiast,
but never dreamed that he was a fanatic. And
how shockingly hard he hits himself! Strong as
Dr. Mastix at Sherborne; but the doctor took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
good care never to hit himself. Upon my word,
I must run away. It is too sad to laugh at.
What resolution that man must have! He scarcely
feels the blows in the agony of his mind. I must
reason with him about it, if I ever can find occasion.
With such violation of His image, God
cannot be well pleased.”</p>

<p>Meditating deeply upon this strange affair, the
parson plodded homewards, for now he knew his
way, with the Murdererʼs Oak for his landmark.
At last he saw his quiet home, and gave a very
gentle knock, because it was so late.</p>

<p>The door was opened by Amy herself, pale,
excited, and jumping.</p>

<p>“Oh, daddy, daddy!” Chock&mdash;chock&mdash;chock&mdash;such
a lot of kisses, and both arms round his
neck.</p>

<p>“Corculum, voluptas, glycymelon, anima
mea&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, papa, say ‘Amy dear,’ and then I shall
know it is you.”</p>

<p>Then she laughed, and then she cried, and presently
fell to at kissing again. I am afraid she
proved herself a fool; but allowance must be
made for her, because she had never learned
before how to get on without her father.</p>

<p>“Oh, you beautiful love of a daddy! I was
quite sure you would come, you know; that you
could not leave me any longer; so I would not
listen to a single word any one of them said.
And I kept the kitchen fire up, and a good fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
in your pet room, dear; and I have got such a
supper for you! Now, off with your coat in a
minute, darling. Oh, how poorly you look, my
own father! But we will soon put you to rights
again. Aunt Doxy is gone to bed, hurrah! and
so are Jemima and Jenny. And she wonʼt have
the impudence to come down, with all her hair in
the jelly&ndash;bags, so I shall have you all to myself,
dada; and if any one can deserve you, I do.”</p>

<p>“My own pet child, my warm&ndash;hearted dear,”
said John, with the tears in his eyes; “I had
not the least idea that your mind was so ill&ndash;regulated.
We must have a course of choriambics
together, or the heavy trimacrine dimeter, as
I have ventured to name it, about which&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“About which not another short syllable, till
you have had a light tri&ndash;mackerel supper, and not
a quasi&ndash;cæsura left even.”</p>

<p>“Why, Amy, you are getting quite witty!”
And John, with one arm still in his overcoat,
looked at her bright eyes wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Of course I am, dad, when you come home.
My learning sparkles at sight of you. Come,
quick now, for fear of my eating you before you
begin your supper. Youʼll have it in the kitchen,
you know, dear, because it will be so much nicer;
and then a pipe by the book&ndash;room fire, and a chat
with your good little daughter. O father, father,
mind you never go away from me such a long,
long time again.”</p>

<p>John thought to himself that, ere many years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
he must go away from his Amy for much more
than a fortnight; but of course he would not damp
her young joy with any such troubles now.</p>

<p>“If you please, my meritorious father, you will
come to the door, and just smell them; and then
you will have five minutes allowed you to put on
your dear old dressing&ndash;gown, and the slippers
worked by the Vestal virgins; five minutes by the
kitchen clock, and not a book to be touched,
mind. Now, donʼt they smell lovely? I put
them on when I knew your knock. The first
mackerel of the season, only caught this afternoon.
I sent word to Mr. Pell for them. He
can do what he likes with the fishermen. And
you know as well as I do, papa, you can never
resist a mackerel.”</p>

<p>When John came down, half the table was
covered with some of his favourite authors&mdash;not
that she meant to let him read, but only because
he would miss his books a great deal more than
the salt&ndash;cellar&mdash;and the other half she was bleaching,
and smoothing, and stroking with a snowy
cloth, soft and sleek as her own bare arms, setting
all things in lovely order, and looking at her
father every moment, with the skirt of her frock
pinned up, and her glossy hair dancing jigs on the
velvet slope of her shoulders. And she made
him hungrier every moment by savoury word and
choice innuendo.</p>

<p>“Worcester sauce, pa, darling, and a little of
the very best butter, not mixed up with flour, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
know, but melting on them, like their native element.
Just see how they are browning, and not
a bit of the skin come off. What is it about the
rhombus, pa, and when am I to read Juvenal?”</p>

<p>“Never, my child.”</p>

<p>“Very well, pa, dear, you know best, of course;
but I thought it was very nice about weighing
Hannibal, in the Excerpta. Father, put that
book down; I canʼt allow any reading. And after
supper I shall expect you to spin me such a yarn,
dear, to wind up the thread of your adventures.”</p>

<p>“<i>Τολυπεύειν</i>,” said John, calmly, although he
was so hungry; “the very word poor Cradock used
in his rendering of that dirge&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppd6 p1">
“‘<i>Μόχθον οὕνεκα τὸν κατʼ ἦμαρ<br />
Ἐκτολυπέσας οἴκαδε,<br />
Μισθὸν φερων, ἤνυσας.</i>’</p>

<p class="p1">Oh, I forgot; ah yes, to be sure. A word, I mean,
which expresses in a figurative and yet homely
manner&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class="pn1">“Cradock, papa! Oh, father, have you been
with him in London? Oh, how Aunt Doxy has
cheated me! You know very well, my own father,
that you cannot tell me a story. Did you go to
London because poor Cradock was very, very ill?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said her father, those soft bright eyes
beamed into his so appealingly; “my own child,
your Cradock is very ill indeed.”</p>

<p>“Not dead, father? Oh, not dead?”</p>

<p>“No, my child; nor in any great danger, I
sincerely believe, just at present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Then eat your supper, pa, while it is hot. I
am so glad you have seen him. I am quite content
with that.”</p>

<p>She believed, or she would not have said it.
And yet how far from the truth it was!</p>

<p>“You shall tell me all after supper, my father.
Thank God for His mercies to me. I am never
in a hurry, dear.”</p>

<p>Yet Amy, in dishing up the mackerel, had the
greatest difficulty (for her breath came short, and
her breast heaved fast) in holding back the tide of
hysterics, which would have spoiled her fatherʼs
supper.</p>

<p>“My amulet, I cannot eat a morsel while I see
your hand shake. Darling, I must tell you all; I
cannot bear your anxiety.”</p>

<p>The second mackerel, a fish of no manners,
instead of curling his tail at the frying, had glued
it to the pan, until a tear of Amyʼs fried, and then
he let go in a moment. John Rosedew caught his
darling child, and drew her to his knees, with the
frying&ndash;pan in her hand; and then he made her look
at him, and she tried to have her eyes dry. Do
what she might she could not speak, only to let her
neck rise, and her drooping eyelids tremble.</p>

<p>“My own lifeʼs love, I have told you the worst.
God is very good to us. Cradock has been at the
point of death, but now he is better a little. Only
his mind is in danger. And it must come home
very slowly, if it comes at all. Now, darling, you
know everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>She took his magnificent silvery head between
her little white hands, and kissed him twice on
either brow, but not a word she said.</p>

<p>“My own sweet child,” cried her father, slowly
passing one arm around her, and swindling his
heart of a smile; “I am apt to make the worst of
things. Let us try to be braver, or at least to
have more faith.”</p>

<p>She leaped up at that very word, with the dawn
of a glorious smile in her eyes, and she took the
frying&ndash;pan once again, and eased out, with a
white&ndash;handled knife, mackerel No. 3. But, upon
second thoughts, she let him slide into the frizzle
again, to keep him warm and comfortable. Her
heart was down very deep just now, but for
all that, her father must have and must enjoy his
supper.</p>

<p>“Father, I am all right now. Only eat your
supper, dear. What a selfish thing I am!”</p>

<p>“Have a bit, my darling heart.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will have a bit of tail, pa, just to test
my cookery. Thatʼs what I call frying! Look at
the blue upon him, and the crisp brown shooting
over it! Come, daddy, no nonsense, if you please.
I could have eaten all three of them if I had only
been out on the warren. And you to come starving
from London! Now No. 3, papa, if you
please.” But she kept her face away from him,
and bent her neck peculiarly.</p>

<p>“How beautifully fresh this ale is! Oh, the
stuff they sell in London! I am almost inclined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
to consider the result of taking another half
glass.”</p>

<p>Her quick feet went pat on the cellar&ndash;steps,
while her father was yet perpending; and she came
back not a whit out of breath, but sweetly fresh
and excited.</p>

<p>“Such a race, pa; because I know of one family
of cockroaches, and half suspect another. They
are so very imprudent. Robert Garnet says that
they stay at home, and keep their Christmas
domestically, and I need not run for fear of them,
at least till the end of April. And perhaps he is
right, because he knows and studies everything
nasty. Only I canʼt believe what he says about
ants, because it contradicts Solomon, who was so
very much older. Now, you paternal darling, let
me froth it up for you.”</p>

<p>“Thank the Lord for as good a meal as ever
one of His children was blessed with.”</p>

<p>The parson stood up as he said these words, and
put his thick but not large hands together, among
the crumbs on the tablecloth.</p>

<p>“Now, if you please, the leastest&mdash;double superlative,
pa, you know, like <i>πρώτιστος</i>, and something
else&mdash;oh, they will pluck me at Oxford!&mdash;the very
leastest little drop of the old French cognac we
bought for parochial rheumatism, with one thin
slice of lemon, an ebullition of water, and half a
knob of sugar.”</p>

<p>Before John could remonstrate, there it was, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
winking at him, and begging to be sniffed before
sipping.</p>

<p>“My pet, you are so premature. How can I
trust your future? You never give me time to
consider a subject, even in the first of its bearings.”</p>

<p>“To be sure not, father. You know quite well
you would take at least eight different views of the
matter, and multiply them into eight others of
people I never heard of. Now the pipe, dear.
You shall have it here, because it is so much
warmer. You know you canʼt fill it properly.”</p>

<p>So the parson, happy in having a child who
could fill a pipe better than he could, leaned back
in his favourite chair, which Amy had wheeled in
for him, and held his long clay in his left hand,
while his right played with her hair, as she sat at
his feet, and coaxed him.</p>

<p>“Sermon all ready, dear?”</p>

<p>“Well, you know best about that, Amy; I
always trust you to arrange them.”</p>

<p>“Never fear, papa; leave it to me. What would
you do without me? I have put you out such a
beauty, because it is Christmas Day: one that
always makes me cry, because I have heard it so
often. But you must have confidence in me.”</p>

<p>“Implicit confidence, my pet. Still I like to
run my eyes over them, for I cannot see as I did.
My eyes are getting so old.”</p>

<p>“Iʼll kiss them till you canʼt see one bit, if you
dare to say that again, papa. Old, indeed! They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
are better than mine. And I can see the pattern
of a lady&ndash;bird, all across the room. There was a
lady&ndash;bird on the window to&ndash;day. At this time of
year, only think! That was good luck, wasnʼt it?
And a dear little robin flew in, and perched upon
the hat&ndash;pegs; and then I <i>knew</i> that you must come
home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you superstitious pet! I must reason with
you to&ndash;morrow.”</p>
